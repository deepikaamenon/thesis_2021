abstract = {The large GTPase dynamin is the first protein shown to catalyze membrane fission. Dynamin and its related proteins are essential to many cell functions, from endocytosis to organelle division and fusion, and it plays a critical role in many physiological functions such as synaptic transmission and muscle contraction. Research of the past three decades has focused on understanding how dynamin works. In this review, we present the basis for an emerging consensus on how dynamin functions. Three properties of dynamin are strongly supported by experimental data: first, dynamin oligomerizes into a helical polymer; second, dynamin oligomer constricts in the presence of GTP; and third, dynamin catalyzes membrane fission upon GTP hydrolysis. We present the two current models for fission, essentially diverging in how GTP energy is spent. We further discuss how future research might solve the remaining open questions presently under discussion.},

@article{Floyd2001,
abstract = {Amphiphysin 1 is a phosphoprotein expressed at high levels in neurons, where it participates in synaptic vesicle endocytosis and neurite outgrowth. It is a substrate for cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) 5, a member of the cyclin-dependent protein kinase family, which has been functionally linked to neuronal migration and neurite outgrowth via its action on the actin cytoskeleton. The yeast homologue of amphiphysin, Rvs167, functions in endocytosis and actin dynamics, is phosphorylated by the cdk5 homologue Pho85, and binds the Pho85 regulatory subunit Pcl2. We show here that amphiphysin 1 interacts with the cdk5-activating subunit p35 and that this interaction is mediated by the conserved NH2-terminal region of amphiphysin. Amphiphysin 1 colocalizes with p35 in the growth cones of neurons and at actin-rich peripheral lamellipodia in transfected fibroblasts. Amphiphysin is phosphorylated by cdk5 in a region including serines 272, 276, and 285. Amphiphysin 1 is also phosphorylated by the cdc2/cyclin B kinase complex in the same region and undergoes mitotic phosphorylation in dividing cells. These data indicate that phosphorylation by members of the cyclin-dependent kinase family is a conserved property of amphiphysin and suggest that this phosphorylation may play an important physiological role both in mitosis and in differentiated cells.},

abstract = {The repair of chromosomal double-strand breaks (DSBs) can be accomplished through homologous recombination in most organisms. We report here that exogenous oligonucleotides can efficiently target for repair a single DSB induced in a chromosome of yeast. The efficiency of recombinational targeting leading to a desired DNA change can be as high as 20{\%} of cells. The DSB was generated either by a regulatable I-SceI endonuclease just before transformation or appeared spontaneously at the site of a long inverted repeat composed of human Alu sequences. The approach used features of our previously described delitto perfetto system for selecting transformants with integrative recombinant oligonucleotides. The DSB repair mediated by pairs of complementary integrative recombinant oligonucleotides was efficient for targeting to homologous sequences that were close to or distant from the DSB and in the presence of a competing homologous chromosome in diploid cells. We also demonstrate that a DSB can strongly stimulate recombination with single-stranded DNA, without strand bias. These findings expand current models of DSB repair. In addition, we establish a high-throughput system for rapid genome-wide modification with oligonucleotides.},

@article{Delanoe-Ayari2004,
abstract = {Physicists have studied the aggregation of adhesive proteins, giving a central role to the elastic properties of membranes, whereas cell biologists have put the emphasis on the cytoskeleton. However, there is a dramatic lack of experimental studies probing both contributions on cellular systems. Here, we tested both mechanisms on living cells. We compared, for the same cell line, the growth of cadherin-GFP patterns on recombinant cadherin-coated surfaces, with the growth of vinculin-GFP patterns on extracellular matrix protein-coated surfaces by using evanescent wave microscopy. In our setup, cadherins are not linked to actin, whereas vinculins are. This property allows us to compare formation of clusters with proteins linked or not to the cytoskeleton and thus study the role of membrane versus cytoskeleton in protein aggregation. Strikingly, the motifs we obtained on both surfaces share common features: they are both elongated and located at the cell edges. We showed that a local force application can impose this symmetry breaking in both cases. However, the origin of the force is different as demonstrated by drug treatment (butanedione monoxime) and hypotonic swelling. Cadherins aggregate when membrane tension is increased, whereas vinculins (cytoplasmic proteins of focal contacts) aggregate when acto-myosin stress fibers are pulling. We propose a mechanism by which membrane tension is localized at cell edges, imposing flattening of membrane and enabling aggregation of cadherins by diffusion. In contrast, cytoplasmic proteins of focal contacts aggregate by opening cryptic sites in focal contacts under acto-myosin contractility.},

@article{Friesen2005,
abstract = {We have used affinity chromatography to identify two proteins that bind to the SH3 domain of the actin cytoskeleton protein Rvs167p: Gyp5p and Gyl1p. Gyp5p has been shown to be a GTPase activating protein (GAP) for Ypt1p, a Rab GTPase involved in ER to Golgi trafficking; Gyl1p is a protein that resembles Gyp5p and has recently been shown to colocalize with and belong to the same protein complex as Gyp5p. We show that Gyl1p and Gyp5p interact directly with each other, likely through their carboxy-terminal coiled-coil regions. In assays of GAP activity, Gyp5p had GAP activity toward Ypt1p and we found that this activity was stimulated by the addition of Gyl1p. Gyl1p had no GAP activity toward Ypt1p. Genetic experiments suggest a role for Gyp5p and Gyl1p in ER to Golgi trafficking, consistent with their biochemical role. Since Rvs167p has a previously characterized role in endocytosis and we have shown here that it interacts with proteins involved in Golgi vesicle trafficking, we suggest that Rvs167p may have a general role in vesicle trafficking.},

@article{Vater1992,
abstract = {The product of the VPS1 gene, Vps1p, is required for the sorting of soluble vacuolar proteins in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We demonstrate here that Vps1p, which contains a consensus tripartite motif for guanine nucleotide binding, is capable of binding and hydrolyzing GTP. Vps1p is a member of a subfamily of large GTP-binding proteins whose members include the vertebrate Mx proteins, the yeast MGM1 protein, the Drosophila melanogaster shibire protein, and dynamin, a bovine brain protein that bundles microtubules in vitro. Disruption of microtubules did not affect the fidelity or kinetics of vacuolar protein sorting, indicating that Vps1p function is not dependent on microtubules. Based on mutational analyses, we propose a two-domain model for Vps1p function. When VPS1 was treated with hydroxylamine, half of all mutations isolated were found to be dominant negative with respect to vacuolar protein sorting. All of the dominant-negative mutations analyzed further mapped to the amino-terminal half of Vps1p and gave rise to full-length protein products. In contrast, recessive mutations gave rise to truncated or unstable protein products. Two large deletion mutations in VPS1 were created to further investigate Vps1p function. A mutant form of Vps1p lacking the carboxy-terminal half of the protein retained the capacity to bind GTP and did not interfere with sorting in a wild-type background. A mutant form of Vps1p lacking the entire GTP-binding domain interfered with vacuolar protein sorting in wild-type cells. We suggest that the amino-terminal domain of Vps1p provides a GTP-binding and hydrolyzing activity required for vacuolar protein sorting, and the carboxy-terminal domain mediates Vps1p association with an as yet unidentified component of the sorting apparatus.},

abstract = {Functioning as key players in cellular regulation of membrane curvature, BAR domain proteins bend bilayers and recruit interaction partners through poorly understood mechanisms. Using electron cryomicroscopy, we present reconstructions of full-length endophilin and its N-terminal N-BAR domain in their membrane-bound state. Endophilin lattices expose large areas of membrane surface and are held together by promiscuous interactions between endophilin's amphipathic N-terminal helices. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations reveal that endophilin lattices are highly dynamic and that the N-terminal helices are required for formation of a stable and regular scaffold. Furthermore, endophilin accommodates different curvatures through a quantized addition or removal of endophilin dimers, which in some cases causes dimerization of endophilin's SH3 domains, suggesting that the spatial presentation of SH3 domains, rather than affinity, governs the recruitment of downstream interaction partners.},

abstract = {Cytoskeleton assembly is instrumental in the regulation of biological functions by physical forces. In a number of key cellular processes, actin filaments elongated by formins such as mDia are subject to mechanical tension, yet how mechanical forces modulate the assembly of actin filaments is an open question. Here, using the viscous drag of a microfluidic flow, we apply calibrated piconewton pulling forces to individual actin filaments that are being elongated at their barbed end by surface-anchored mDia1 proteins. We show that mDia1 is mechanosensitive and that the elongation rate of filaments is increased up to two-fold by the application of a pulling force. We also show that mDia1 is able to track a depolymerizing barbed end in spite of an opposing pulling force, which means that mDia1 can efficiently put actin filaments under mechanical tension. Our findings suggest that formin function in cells is tightly coupled to the mechanical activity of other machineries.

Las17p/Bee1p has been shown to be important for actin patch assembly and actin polymerization. Here we show that Las17p interacts with the Arp2/3 complex. LAS17 is an allele-specific multicopy suppressor of ARP2 and ARP3 mutations; overexpression restores both actin patch organization and endocytosis defects in ARP2 temperature-sensitive (ts) cells. Six of seven ARP2 ts mutants and at least one ARP3 ts mutant are synthetically lethal with las17$\Delta$ ts confirming functional interaction with the Arp2/3 complex. Further characterization of las17$\Delta$ cells showed that receptor-mediated internalization of $\alpha$ factor by the Ste2 receptor is severely defective. The polarity of normal bipolar bud site selection is lost. Las17-gfp remains localized in cortical patches in vivo independently of polymerized actin and is required for the polarized localization of Arp2/3 as well as actin. Coimmunoprecipitation of Arp2p with Las17p indicates that Las17p interacts directly with the complex. Two hybrid results also suggest that Las17p interacts with actin, verprolin, Rvs167p and several other proteins including Src homology 3 (SH3) domain proteins, suggesting that Las17p may integrate signals from different regulatory cascades destined for the Arp2/3p complex and the actin cytoskeleton.},

To determine the functional relationship between these proteins and dynamin, we have analyzed endocytic intermediates that accumulate in cells that lack dynamin (derived from dynamin 1 and 2 double conditional knockout mice). In these cells, actin-nucleating proteins, actin, and BAR domain proteins accumulate at the base of arrested endocytic clathrin-coated pits, where they support the growth of dynamic long tubular necks. These results, which we show reflect the sequence of events in wild-type cells, demonstrate a concerted action of these proteins prior to, and independent of, dynamin and emphasize similarities between clathrin-mediated endocytosis in yeast and higher eukaryotes. Our data also demonstrate that the relationship between dynamin and actin is intimately connected to dynamin's endocytic role and that dynamin terminates a powerful actin- and BAR protein-dependent tubulating activity.},

abstract = {In animal and plant cells, mitotic chromatin locally generates microtubules that self-organize into a mitotic spindle, and its dimensions and bipolar symmetry are essential for accurate chromosome segregation. By immobilizing microscopic chromatin-coated beads on slide surfaces using a microprinting technique, we have examined the effect of chromatin on the dimensions and symmetry of spindles in Xenopus laevis cytoplasmic extracts. While circular spots with diameters around 14–18 $\mu$m trigger bipolar spindle formation, larger spots generate an incorrect number of poles. We also examined lines of chromatin with various dimensions. Their length determined the number of poles that formed, with a 6 × 18 $\mu$m rectangular patch generating normal spindle morphology. Around longer lines, multiple poles formed and the structures were disorganized. While lines thinner than 10 $\mu$m generated symmetric structures, thicker lines induced the formation of asymmetric structures where all microtubules are on the same side of the line. Our results show that chromatin defines spindle shape and orientation.For a video summary of this article, see the PaperFlick file available with the online Supplemental Data.},

Both types of HMMs formed fluorescent clusters along actin filaments when added at substoichiometric amounts. Quantitative analysis of the fluorescence intensity of the HMM clusters revealed that there are two distinct types of cooperative binding. The stronger form was observed along Ca2+-actin filaments with substoichiometric amounts of bound phalloidin, in which the density of HMM molecules in the clusters was comparable to full decoration. The novel, weaker form was observed along Mg2+-actin filaments with and without stoichiometric amounts of phalloidin. HMM density in the clusters of the weaker form was several-fold lower than full decoration. The weak cooperative binding required sub-micromolar ATP, and did not occur in the absence of nucleotides or in the presence of ADP and ADP-Vi. The G680V mutant of Dictyostelium HMM, which over-occupies the ADP-Pi bound state in the presence of actin filaments and ATP, also formed clusters along Mg2+-actin filaments, suggesting that the weak cooperative binding of HMM to actin filaments occurs or initiates at an intermediate state of the actomyosin-ADP-Pi complex other than that attained by adding ADP-Vi.},

abstract = {During endocytosis, actin-dependent forces are needed to oppose internal turgor pressure for invagination of the plasma membrane. Live-cell imaging shows that addition of sorbitol to the medium significantly accelerates early steps in the endocytic process and rescues defects of endocytic mutants in fission yeast., Yeast and other walled cells possess high internal turgor pressure that allows them to grow and survive in the environment. This turgor pressure, however, may oppose the invagination of the plasma membrane needed for endocytosis. Here we study the effects of turgor pressure on endocytosis in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe by time-lapse imaging of individual endocytic sites. Decreasing effective turgor pressure by addition of sorbitol to the media significantly accelerates early steps in the endocytic process before actin assembly and membrane ingression but does not affect the velocity or depth of ingression of the endocytic pit in wild-type cells. Sorbitol also rescues endocytic ingression defects of certain endocytic mutants and of cells treated with a low dose of the actin inhibitor latrunculin A. Endocytosis proceeds after removal of the cell wall, suggesting that the cell wall does not contribute mechanically to this process. These studies suggest that endocytosis is governed by a mechanical balance between local actin-dependent inward forces and opposing forces from high internal turgor pressure on the plasma membrane.},

abstract = {Epithelial wound healing relies on tissue movements and cell shape changes. Our work shows that, immediately after wounding, there was a dramatic cytoskeleton remodeling consisting of a pulse of actomyosin filaments that assembled in cells around the wound edge and flowed from cell to cell toward the margin of the wound. We show that this actomyosin flow was regulated by Diaphanous and ROCK and that it elicited a wave of apical cell constriction that culminated in the formation of the leading edge actomyosin cable, a structure that is essential for wound closure. Calcium signaling played an important role in this process, as its intracellular concentration increased dramatically immediately after wounding, and down-regulation of transient receptor potential channel M, a stress-activated calcium channel, also impaired the actomyosin flow. Lowering the activity of Gelsolin, a known calcium-activated actin filament–severing protein, also impaired the wound response, indicating that cleaving the existing actin filament network is an important part of the cytoskeleton remodeling process.},

abstract = {The scaffolding protein insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate p53 (IRSp53), a ubiquitous regulator of the actin cytoskeleton, mediates filopodia formation under the control of Rho-family GTPases. IRSp53 comprises a central SH3 domain, which binds to proline-rich regions of a wide range of actin regulators, and a conserved N-terminal IRSp53/MIM homology domain (IMD) that harbours F-actin-bundling activity. Here, we present the crystal structure of this novel actin-bundling domain revealing a coiled-coil domain that self-associates into a 180 {\AA}-long zeppelin-shaped dimer. Sedimentation velocity experiments confirm the presence of a single molecular species of twice the molecular weight of the monomer in solution. Mutagenesis of conserved basic residues at the extreme ends of the dimer abrogated actin bundling in vitro and filopodia formation in vivo, demonstrating that IMD-mediated actin bundling is required for IRSp53-induced filopodia formation. This study promotes an expanded view of IRSp53 as an actin regulator that integrates scaffolding and effector functions.},

@article{Murrell2012,
abstract = {Here we develop a minimal model of the cell actomyosin cortex by forming a quasi-2D cross-linked filamentous actin (F-actin) network adhered to a model cell membrane and contracted by myosin thick filaments. Myosin motors generate both compressive and tensile stresses on F-actin and consequently induce large bending fluctuations, which reduces their effective persistence length to {\textless}1 $\mu$m. Over a large range of conditions, we show the extent of network contraction corresponds exactly to the extent of individual F-actin shortening via buckling. This demonstrates an essential role of buckling in breaking the symmetry between tensile and compressive stresses to facilitate mesoscale network contraction of up to 80{\%} strain. Portions of buckled F-actin with a radius of curvature ∼300 nm are prone to severing and thus compressive stresses mechanically coordinate contractility with F-actin severing, the initial step of F-actin turnover. Finally, the F-actin curvature acquired by myosin-induced stresses can be further constrained by adhesion of the network to a membrane, accelerating filament severing but inhibiting the long-range transmission of the stresses necessary for network contractility. Thus, the extent of membrane adhesion can regulate the coupling between network contraction and F-actin severing. These data demonstrate the essential role of the nonlinear response of F-actin to compressive stresses in potentiating both myosin-mediated contractility and filament severing. This may serve as a general mechanism to mechanically coordinate contractility and cortical dynamics across diverse actomyosin assemblies in smooth muscle and nonmuscle cells.},

abstract = {Responses of cells to mechanical properties of the adhesion substrate were examined by culturing normal rat kidney epithelial and 3T3 fibroblastic cells on a collagen-coated polyacrylamide substrate that allows the flexibility to be varied while maintaining a constant chemical environment. Compared with cells on rigid substrates, those on flexible substrates showed reduced spreading and increased rates of motility or lamellipodial activity. Microinjection of fluorescent vinculin indicated that focal adhesions on flexible substrates were irregularly shaped and highly dynamic whereas those on firm substrates had a normal morphology and were much more stable. Cells on flexible substrates also contained a reduced amount of phosphotyrosine at adhesion sites. Treatment of these cells with phenylarsine oxide, a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, induced the formation of normal, stable focal adhesions similar to those on firm substrates. Conversely, treatment of cells on firm substrates with myosin inhibitors 2,3-butanedione monoxime or KT5926 caused the reduction of both vinculin and phosphotyrosine at adhesion sites. These results demonstrate the ability of cells to survey the mechanical properties of their surrounding environment and suggest the possible involvement of both protein tyrosine phosphorylation and myosin-generated cortical forces in this process. Such response to physical parameters likely represents an important mechanism of cellular interaction with the surrounding environment within a complex organism.},

abstract = {Cleavage furrow formation at the first cell division of sea urchin and sand dollar eggs was investigated in detail by fluorescence staining of actin filaments with rhodamine-phalloidin of either whole eggs or isolated egg cortices. Cortical actin filaments were clustered at anaphase and then the clusters became fibrillar at the end of anaphase. The timing when the contractile ring actin filaments appear was precisely determined in the course of mitosis: accumulation of the contractile ring actin filaments at the equatorial cell cortex is first noticed at the beginning of telophase (shortly before furrow formation), when the chromosomal vesicles are fusing with each other. The accumulated actin filaments were not well organized at the early stage but were organized into parallel bundles as the furrowing progressed. The bundles were finally fused into a tightly packed filament belt. Wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)-binding sites were distributed on the surface of the egg in a manner similar to the actin filaments after anaphase. The WGA-binding sites became accumulated in the contractile ring together with the contractile ring actin filaments, indicating an intimate relationship between these sites and actin filament-anchoring sites on the plasma membrane. Myosin also appeared in the contractile ring together with the actin filaments. The 'cleavage stimulus', a signal hypothesized by Rappaport (reviewed by R. Rappaport (1986) Int. Rev. Cytol. 105, 245-281) was suggested to induce aggregation or bundling of the actin filaments in the cortical layer.},

abstract = {Learning, defined as a change in behaviour evoked by experience, has hitherto been investigated almost exclusively in multicellular neural organisms. Evidence for learning in non-neural multicellular organisms is scant, and only a few unequivocal reports of learning have been described in single-celled organisms. Here we demonstrate habituation, an unmistakable form of learning, in the non-neural organism Physarum polycephalum. In our experiment, using chemotaxis as the behavioural output and quinine or caffeine as the stimulus, we showed that P. polycephalum learnt to ignore quinine or caffeine when the stimuli were repeated, but responded again when the stimulus was withheld for a certain time. Our results meet the principle criteria that have been used to demonstrate habituation: responsiveness decline and spontaneous recovery. To distinguish habituation from sensory adaptation or motor fatigue, we also show stimulus specificity. Our results point to the diversity of organisms lacking neurons, which likely display a hitherto unrecognized capacity for learning, and suggest that slime moulds may be an ideal model system in which to investigate fundamental mechanisms underlying learning processes. Besides, documenting learning in non-neural organisms such as slime moulds is centrally important to a comprehensive, phylogenetic understanding of when and where in the tree of life the earliest manifestations of learning evolved.},

The actin cytoskeleton is an integral part of the cell cortex, and there is growing evidence that F-actin plays a direct role in these endocytic events. Genetic studies in yeast have firmly established a functional connection between actin and endocytosis. Identification of several proteins that may function at the interface between actin and the endocytic machinery has provided further evidence for this association in both yeast and mammalian cells. Several of these proteins are directly involved in regulating actin assembly and could thus harness forces produced during actin polymerization to facilitate specific steps in the endocytic process. Recent microscopy studies in mammalian cells provide powerful evidence that localized recruitment and polymerization of actin occurs at endocytic sites. In this review, we focus on progress made in elucidating the functions of the actin cytoskeleton in endocytosis.},

abstract = {During hyperosmotic shock, Saccharomyces cerevisiae adjusts to physiological challenges, including large plasma membrane invaginations generated by rapid cell shrinkage. Calcineurin, the Ca2+/calmodulin–dependent phosphatase, is normally cytosolic but concentrates in puncta and at sites of polarized growth during intense osmotic stress; inhibition of calcineurin-activated gene expression suggests that restricting its access to substrates tunes calcineurin signaling specificity. Hyperosmotic shock promotes calcineurin binding to and dephosphorylation of the PI(4,5)P2 phosphatase synaptojanin/Inp53/Sjl3 and causes dramatic calcineurin-dependent reorganization of PI(4,5)P2-enriched membrane domains. Inp53 normally promotes sorting at the trans-Golgi network but localizes to cortical actin patches in osmotically stressed cells. By activating Inp53, calcineurin repolarizes the actin cytoskeleton and maintains normal plasma membrane morphology in synaptojanin-limited cells. In response to hyperosmotic shock and calcineurin-dependent regulation, Inp53 shifts from associating predominantly with clathrin to interacting with endocytic proteins Sla1, Bzz1, and Bsp1, suggesting that Inp53 mediates stress-specific endocytic events. This response has physiological and molecular similarities to calcineurin-regulated activity-dependent bulk endocytosis in neurons, which retrieves a bolus of plasma membrane deposited by synaptic vesicle fusion. We propose that activation of Ca2+/calcineurin and PI(4,5)P2 signaling to regulate endocytosis is a fundamental and conserved response to excess membrane in eukaryotic cells.},

abstract = {There are two vertebrate nonmuscle myosin heavy chain (MHC) genes that encode two separate isoforms of the heavy chain, MHC-A and MHC-B. Recent work has identified additional, alternatively spliced isoforms of MHC-B cDNA with inserted sequences of 30 nucleotides (chicken and human) or 48 nucleotides (Xenopus) at a site corresponding to the ATP binding region in the MHC protein (Takahashi, M., Kawamoto, S., and Adelstein, R. S.(1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 17864-17871) and Bhatia-Dey, N., Adelstein, R. S., and Dawid, I. B. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 90, 2856-2859). The deduced amino acid sequence of these inserts contains a consensus sequence for phosphorylation by cyclin-p34 (cdc2) kinase. In cultured Xenopus XTC cells, we have identified two inserted MHC-B isoforms and a noninserted MHC-A isoform by immunoblotting of cell extracts. When myosin was immunoprecipitated from XTC cells and phosphorylated in vitro with cdc2 kinase, the kinase catalyzed the phosphorylation of both inserted MHC-B isoforms but not MHC-A. Isoelectric focusing of tryptic peptides generated from MHC-B phosphorylated with cdc2 kinase revealed one major phosphopeptide that was purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography and sequenced. The phosphorylated residue was Ser-214, the cdc2 kinase consensus site within the insert near the ATP binding region. The same site was phosphorylated in intact XTC cells during log phase of growth and in cell-free lysates of Xenopus eggs stabilized in second meiotic metaphase but not interphase. Moreover, Ser-214 phosphorylation was detected during maturation of Xenopus oocytes when the cdc2 kinase-containing maturation-promoting factor was activated, but not in G2 interphase-arrested oocytes. These results demonstrate that MHC-B phosphorylation is tightly regulated by cdc2 kinase during meiotic cell cycles. Furthermore, MHC-A and MHC-B isoforms are differentially phosphorylated at these stages, suggesting that they may serve different functions in these cells.},

abstract = {Using a structure–function analysis, we find that Rvs proteins are initially recruited to sites of endocytosis through their curvature-sensing and membrane-binding ability in a manner dependent on complex sphingolipids., BAR domains are protein modules that bind to membranes and promote membrane curvature. One type of BAR domain, the N-BAR domain, contains an additional N-terminal amphipathic helix, which contributes to membrane-binding and bending activities. The only known N-BAR-domain proteins in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Rvs161 and Rvs167, are required for endocytosis. We have explored the mechanism of N-BAR-domain function in the endocytosis process using a combined biochemical and genetic approach. We show that the purified Rvs161–Rvs167 complex binds to liposomes in a curvature-independent manner and promotes tubule formation in vitro. Consistent with the known role of BAR domain polymerization in membrane bending, we found that Rvs167 BAR domains interact with each other at cortical actin patches in vivo. To characterize N-BAR-domain function in endocytosis, we constructed yeast strains harboring changes in conserved residues in the Rvs161 and Rvs167 N-BAR domains. In vivo analysis of the rvs endocytosis mutants suggests that Rvs proteins are initially recruited to sites of endocytosis through their membrane-binding ability. We show that inappropriate regulation of complex sphingolipid and phosphoinositide levels in the membrane can impinge on Rvs function, highlighting the relationship between membrane components and N-BAR-domain proteins in vivo.},

abstract = {Cell shape changes are critical for morphogenetic events such as gastrulation, neurulation, and organogenesis. However, the cell biology driving cell shape changes is poorly understood, especially in vertebrates. The beginning of Xenopus laevis gastrulation is marked by the apical constriction of bottle cells in the dorsal marginal zone, which bends the tissue and creates a crevice at the blastopore lip. We found that bottle cells contribute significantly to gastrulation, as their shape change can generate the force required for initial blastopore formation. As actin and myosin are often implicated in contraction, we examined their localization and function in bottle cells. F-actin and activated myosin accumulate apically in bottle cells, and actin and myosin inhibitors either prevent or severely perturb bottle cell formation, showing that actomyosin contractility is required for apical constriction. Microtubules were localized in apicobasally directed arrays in bottle cells, emanating from the apical surface. Surprisingly, apical constriction was inhibited in the presence of nocodazole but not taxol, suggesting that intact, but not dynamic, microtubules are required for apical constriction. Our results indicate that actomyosin contractility is required for bottle cell morphogenesis and further suggest a novel and unpredicted role for microtubules during apical constriction.},

The actin cytoskeleton is an integral part of the cell cortex, and there is growing evidence that F-actin plays a direct role in these endocytic events. Genetic studies in yeast have firmly established a functional connection between actin and endocytosis. Identification of several proteins that may function at the interface between actin and the endocytic machinery has provided further evidence for this association in both yeast and mammalian cells. Several of these proteins are directly involved in regulating actin assembly and could thus harness forces produced during actin polymerization to facilitate specific steps in the endocytic process. Recent microscopy studies in mammalian cells provide powerful evidence that localized recruitment and polymerization of actin occurs at endocytic sites. In this review, we focus on progress made in elucidating the functions of the actin cytoskeleton in endocytosis.},

Morphological stages of vesicle formation are mirrored by progression through various protein modules (complexes). The process involves the formation of a putative FCH domain only (FCHO) initiation complex, which matures through adaptor protein 2 (AP2)-dependent cargo selection, and subsequent coat building, dynamin-mediated scission and finally auxilin- and heat shock cognate 70 (HSC70)-dependent uncoating.

The molecular basis for the involvement of endocytic regulators in unconventional functions that influence the cytoskeleton, cell cycle, signaling, and gene regulation are described here.

abstract = {Summary 
Assembled actin filaments support cellular signaling, intracellular trafficking, and cytokinesis. ATP hydrolysis triggered by actin assembly provides the structural cues for filament turnover in vivo. Here, we present the cryo-electron microscopic (cryo-EM) structure of filamentous actin (F-actin) in the presence of phosphate, with the visualization of some $\alpha$-helical backbones and large side chains. A complete atomic model based on the EM map identified intermolecular interactions mediated by bound magnesium and phosphate ions. Comparison of the F-actin model with G-actin monomer crystal structures reveals a critical role for bending of the conserved proline-rich loop in triggering phosphate release following ATP hydrolysis. Crystal structures of G-actin show that mutations in this loop trap the catalytic site in two intermediate states of the ATPase cycle. The combined structural information allows us to propose a detailed molecular mechanism for the biochemical events, including actin polymerization and ATPase activation, critical for actin filament dynamics.},

@article{Machesky1998,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The actin-related proteins Arp2 and Arp3 are part of a seven-protein complex which is localized in the lamellipodia of a variety of cell types, and in actin-rich spots of unknown function. The Arp2/3 complex enhances actin nucleation and causes branching and crosslinking of actin filaments in vitro; in vivo it is thought to drive the formation of lamellipodia and to be a control center for actin-based motility. The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein, WASP, is an adaptor protein implicated in the transmission of signals from tyrosine kinase receptors and small GTPases to the actin cytoskeleton. Scar1 is a member of a new family of proteins related to WASP, and it may also have a role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton. Scar1 is the human homologue of Dictyostelium Scar1, which is thought to connect G-protein-coupled receptors to the actin cytoskeleton. The mammalian Scar family contains at least four members. We have examined the relationships between WASP, Scar1, and the Arp2/3 complex.
RESULTS: We have identified WASP and its relative Scar1 as proteins that interact with the Arp2/3 complex. We have used deletion analysis to show that both WASP and Scar1 interact with the p21 subunit of the Arp2/3 complex through their carboxyl termini. Overexpression of carboxy-terminal fragments of Scar1 or WASP in cells caused a disruption in the localization of the Arp2/3 complex and, concomitantly, induced a complete loss of lamellipodia and actin spots. The induction of lamellipodia by platelet-derived growth factor was also suppressed by overexpression of the fragment of Scar1 that binds to the Arp2/3 complex.
CONCLUSIONS: We have identified a conserved sequence domain in proteins of the WASP family that binds to the Arp2/3 complex. Overexpression of this domain in cells disrupts the localization of the Arp2/3 complex and inhibits lamellipodia formation. Our data suggest that WASP-related proteins may regulate the actin cytoskeleton through the Arp2/3 complex.},

Here, using a cell-free system, we provide direct morphological evidence in support of this hypothesis.

Moreover, amphiphysin-1 assembles with dynamin-1 into ring-like structures around the tubules and enhances the liposome-fragmenting activity of dynamin-1 in the presence of GTP.

abstract = {Microtubules are long, proteinaceous filaments that perform structural functions in eukaryotic cells by defining cellular shape and serving as tracks for intracellular motor proteins. We report the first accurate measurements of the flexural rigidity of microtubules. By analyzing the thermally driven fluctuations in their shape, we estimated the mean flexural rigidity of taxol-stabilized microtubules to be 2.2 x 10(-23) Nm2 (with 6.4{\%} uncertainty) for seven unlabeled microtubules and 2.1 x 10(-23) Nm2 (with 4.7{\%} uncertainty) for eight rhodamine-labeled microtubules. These values are similar to earlier, less precise estimates of microtubule bending stiffness obtained by modeling flagellar motion. A similar analysis on seven rhodamine-phalloidin-labeled actin filaments gave a flexural rigidity of 7.3 x 10(-26) Nm2 (with 6{\%} uncertainty), consistent with previously reported results. The flexural rigidity of these microtubules corresponds to a persistence length of 5,200 microns showing that a microtubule is rigid over cellular dimensions. By contrast, the persistence length of an actin filament is only approximately 17.7 microns, perhaps explaining why actin filaments within cells are usually cross-linked into bundles. The greater flexural rigidity of a microtubule compared to an actin filament mainly derives from the former's larger cross-section. If tubulin were homogeneous and isotropic, then the microtubule's Young's modulus would be approximately 1.2 GPa, similar to Plexiglas and rigid plastics. Microtubules are expected to be almost inextensible: the compliance of cells is due primarily to filament bending or sliding between filaments rather than the stretching of the filaments themselves.},

abstract = {Internalization of receptors, lipids, pathogens, and other cargo at the plasma membrane involves several different pathways and requires coordinated interactions between a variety of protein and lipid molecules. The actin cytoskeleton is an integral part of the cell cortex, and there is growing evidence that F-actin plays a direct role in these endocytic events. Genetic studies in yeast have firmly established a functional connection between actin and endocytosis. Identification of several proteins that may function at the interface between actin and the endocytic machinery has provided further evidence for this association in both yeast and mammalian cells. Several of these proteins are directly involved in regulating actin assembly and could thus harness forces produced during actin polymerization to facilitate specific steps in the endocytic process. Recent microscopy studies in mammalian cells provide powerful evidence that localized recruitment and polymerization of actin occurs at endocytic sites. In this review, we focus on progress made in elucidating the functions of the actin cytoskeleton in endocytosis.},

abstract = {Expression of the Ha-ras oncogene in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts leads to a set point shift of cell volume regulation and causes an increase in cell volume by activation of Na+/H+ exchange and Na+, K+, 2Cl- cotransport. Since both ion transport systems are thought to be governed by the cytoskeleton, the aim of this study was to examine the alterations in growth characteristics and cytoskeletal organization due to the expression of the oncogene. The experiments were performed on NIH 3T3 fibroblasts transfected with a transforming Ha-ras MMTV-LTR construct and expressing the oncogene after treatment with low serum medium and 1 mumol/l dexamethasone (+ras cells). Transfected cells not expressing the oncogene (-ras cells) and treated with low serum medium, but without the addition of dexamethasone, served as controls. The growth characteristics were examined and the cytoskeletal architecture was visualized by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy using specific antibodies and fluorescent dyes. Expression of the ras oncogene was accompanied by a significant and serum-independent increase in proliferative activity irrespective from the coating of the dishes with attachment factors (poly-L-lysine, collagen type I). Both, -ras and +ras cells, proliferated slower on substrates coated with poly-L-lysine than on tissue culture plastic or collagen type I. Expression of the ras oncogene also resulted in a significant increase in cell volume which was independent from the substrate. +ras Cells became more elongated, exhibited long cytoplasmic protrusions and tended to detach when compared with -ras cells. Examination of the cytoskeletal architecture in +ras and -ras cells revealed marked differences such as a depolymerization of the stress fiber network to strongly fluorescent "focals" as well as the absence of vinculin-containing attachment plaques (focal contacts), a disorganization of non-muscle myosin and of cell surface fibronectin in +ras cells. In addition, a retraction of microtubules and vimentin filaments to the perinuclear region was also observed in +ras cells. For comparison, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts which were not transfected with the ras oncogene (0ras cells) and which were also subjected to the experimental conditions described above (low serum medium +/- dexamethasone), did not exhibit the cytoskeletal alterations as observed for +ras cells. The results demonstrate that the expression of ras oncogene causes not only profound alterations in the proliferative activity, cell volume and cell morphology, but also a marked reorganization of cytoskeletal architecture, which may participate in the altered regulation of volume-regulatory ion transporters in the cell membrane.},

abstract = {Advanced technologies and biology have extremely different physical implementations, but they are far more alike in systems-level organization than is widely appreciated. Convergent evolution in both domains produces modular architectures that are composed of elaborate hierarchies of protocols and layers of feedback regulation, are driven by demand for robustness to uncertain environments, and use often imprecise components. This complexity may be largely hidden in idealized laboratory settings and in normal operation, becoming conspicuous only when contributing to rare cascading failures. These puzzling and paradoxical features are neither accidental nor artificial, but derive from a deep and necessary interplay between complexity and robustness, modularity, feedback, and fragility. This review describes insights from engineering theory and practice that can shed some light on biological complexity.},

abstract = {Summary
F-BAR domain proteins regulate and sense membrane curvature by interacting with negatively charged phospholipids and assembling into higher-order scaffolds. However, regulatory mechanisms controlling these interactions are poorly understood. Here, we show that Drosophila Nervous Wreck (Nwk) is autoregulated by a C-terminal SH3 domain module that interacts directly with its F-BAR domain. Surprisingly, this autoregulation does not mediate a simple “on-off” switch for membrane remodeling. Instead, the isolated Nwk F-BAR domain efficiently assembles into higher-order structures and deforms membranes only within a limited range of negative membrane charge, and autoregulation elevates this range. Thus, autoregulation could either reduce membrane binding or promote higher-order assembly, depending on local cellular membrane composition. Our findings uncover an unexpected mechanism by which lipid composition directs membrane remodeling.},

abstract = {Fluorescence live-cell imaging has temporally resolved the conserved choreography of more than 30 proteins involved in clathrin and actin-mediated endocytic budding from the plasma membrane. However, the resolution of these studies is insufficient to unveil how the endocytic machinery actually drives membrane deformation in vivo. In this study, we use quantitative immuno-EM to introduce the temporal dimension to the ultrastructural analysis of membrane budding and define changes in the topography of the lipid bilayer coupled to the dynamics of endocytic proteins with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution. Using this approach, we frame the emergence of membrane curvature with respect to the recruitment of endocytic factors and show that constriction of the invaginations correlates with translocation of membrane-sculpting proteins. Furthermore, we show that initial bending of the plasma membrane is independent of actin and clathrin polymerization and precedes building of an actin cap branched by the Arp2/3 complex. Finally, our data indicate that constriction and additional elongation of the endocytic profiles require the mechanochemical activity of the myosins-I. Altogether, this work provides major insights into the molecular mechanisms driving membrane deformation in a cellular context.},

abstract = {The membrane bending and GTPase-binding functions of proteins from the BAR-domain family, BAR-domains recently took centre stage in science through a report on the crystal structure of this domain in Drosophila Amphiphysin. Though only weakly conserved at the sequence level, the structure of the BAR domain shows striking similarity to the GTPase-binding domain of Arfaptin 2, an effector of Rho- and Arf- GTPases. On the basis of this sequence and structural similarity, these two proteins have been classified as belonging to the same family, the BAR-domain family, and they probably also have similar functional characteristics. Presented here are the results of a database search for the sequence of the BAR domain of Amphiphysin and Arfaptin 2. This search identified a variety of related proteins, most of which are involved in intracellular transport and especially in endocytosis. For example, the BAR-domain family includes Endophilins, GTPase-activating proteins of the Centaurin$\beta$ family and Oligophrenins, the adaptor proteins APPL1 and APPL2 that were recently shown to interact with the small GTPase Rab5, as well as members of the Sorting nexin family. On the basis of the structures of Amphiphysin and Arfaptin 2 and the cellular role of Amphiphysins in the early steps of endocytosis, the functions of the BAR domain have been defined as a dimerization motif and as sensing and inducing membrane curvature. However, data on Arfaptin 2 and now also on the Adaptor proteins APPL1 and 2 suggest that another function of the BAR domain is to bind to small GTPases.},

abstract = {Traction forces produced by moving fibroblasts have been observed as distortions in flexible substrata including wrinkling of thin, silicone rubber films. Traction forces generated by fibroblast lamellae were thought to represent the forces required to move the cell forwards. However, traction forces could not be detected with faster moving cell types such as leukocytes and growth cones (Harris, A. K., D. Stopak, and P. Wild. 1981. Nature (Lond.). 290:249-251). We have developed a new assay in which traction forces produced by rapidly locomoting fish keratocytes can be detected by the two-dimensional displacements of small beads embedded in the plane of an elastic substratum. Traction forces were not detected at the rapidly extending front edge of the cell. Instead the largest traction forces were exerted perpendicular to the left and right cell margins. The maximum traction forces exerted by keratocytes were estimated to be approximately 2 x 10(-8) N. The pattern of traction forces can be related to the locomotion of a single keratocyte in terms of lamellar contractility and area of close cell-substratum contact.},

abstract = {The ability of a cell to distribute contractile stresses across the extracellular matrix in a spatially heterogeneous fashion underlies many cellular behaviors, including motility and tissue assembly. Here we investigate the biophysical basis of this phenomenon by using femtosecond laser nanosurgery to measure the viscoelastic recoil and cell-shape contributions of contractile stress fibers (SFs) located in specific compartments of living cells. Upon photodisruption and recoil, myosin light chain kinase-dependent SFs located along the cell periphery display much lower effective elasticities and higher plateau retraction distances than Rho-associated kinase-dependent SFs located in the cell center, with severing of peripheral fibers uniquely triggering a dramatic contraction of the entire cell within minutes of fiber irradiation. Image correlation spectroscopy reveals that when one population of SFs is pharmacologically dissipated, actin density flows toward the other population. Furthermore, dissipation of peripheral fibers reduces the elasticity and increases the plateau retraction distance of central fibers, and severing central fibers under these conditions triggers cellular contraction. Together, these findings show that SFs regulated by different myosin activators exhibit different mechanical properties and cell shape contributions. They also suggest that some fibers can absorb components and assume mechanical roles of other fibers to stabilize cell shape.},

Here, we studied membrane tube pulling in ternary mixtures of sphingomyelin, phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol. Two salient results emerged: the lipid composition is significantly different in the tubes and in the vesicles; tube fission is observed when phase separation is generated in the tubes. This shows that lipid sorting may depend critically on both membrane curvature and phase separation. Phase separation also appears to be important for membrane fission in tubes pulled out of giant liposomes or purified Golgi membranes.},

Such vesicles have been seen associated with micropinocytosis. A simple and rapid procedure for the purification of coated vesicles from pig brain has been developed. The structures obtained have an external diameter of about 600 {\AA} and a remarkable network-like appearance. The most striking observation about these vesicles, reported here, is that they contain essentially just one protein species, having an apparent molecular weight on sodium dodecyl sulphate gels of about 180,000. Digestion of the coats with trypsin or Pronase shows that most of this protein is located on the external surface (i.e. facing the cytoplasm) of these structures. The lipid vesicles thus liberated appear to have an external diameter of about 350 {\AA}. An estimate of the number of protein molecules per vesicle is consistent with the coat having an icosahedral arrangement of subunits.},

abstract = {Yeast and other walled cells possess high internal turgor pressure that allows them to grow and survive in the environment. This turgor pressure, however, may oppose the invagination of the plasma membrane needed for endocytosis. Here we study the effects of turgor pressure on endocytosis in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe by time-lapse imaging of individual endocytic sites. Decreasing effective turgor pressure by addition of sorbitol to the media significantly accelerates early steps in the endocytic process before actin assembly and membrane ingression but does not affect the velocity or depth of ingression of the endocytic pit in wild-type cells. Sorbitol also rescues endocytic ingression defects of certain endocytic mutants and of cells treated with a low dose of the actin inhibitor latrunculin A. Endocytosis proceeds after removal of the cell wall, suggesting that the cell wall does not contribute mechanically to this process. These studies suggest that endocytosis is governed by a mechanical balance between local actin-dependent inward forces and opposing forces from high internal turgor pressure on the plasma membrane.},

abstract = {Cortical actin patches are dynamic structures required for endocytosis in yeast [1]. Recent studies have shown that components of cortical patches localize to the plasma membrane in a precisely orchestrated manner, and their movements at and away from the plasma membrane may define the endocytic membrane invagination and vesicle scission events, respectively [2]. Here, through live-cell imaging, we analyze the dynamics of the highly conserved class I unconventional myosin, Myo5, which also localizes to cortical patches and is known to be involved in endocytosis and actin nucleation 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8. Myo5 exhibits a pattern of dynamic localization different from all cortical patch components analyzed to date. Myo5 associates with cortical patches only transiently and remains stationary during its brief cortical lifespan. The peak of Myo5 association with cortical patches immediately precedes the fast movement of Arp2/3 complex-associated structures away from the plasma membrane, thus correlating precisely with the proposed vesicle scission event. To further test the role of Myo5, we generated a temperature-sensitive mutant myo5 allele. In the myo5 mutant cells, Myo5 exhibits a significantly extended cortical lifespan as a result of a general impairment of Myo5 function, and Arp2 patches exhibit an extended slow-movement phase prior to the fast movement toward the cell interior. The myo5 mutant cells are defective in fluid-phase endocytosis and exhibit an increased number of invaginations on the membrane. Based on these results, we hypothesize that the myosin I motor protein facilitates the membrane fusion/vesicle scission event of endocytosis.},

Correlative electron and fluorescence microscopy has the potential to elucidate the ultrastructural details of dynamic and rare cellular events, but has been limited by low precision and sensitivity. Here we present a method for direct mapping of signals originating from ∼20 fluorescent protein molecules to 3D electron tomograms with a precision of less than 100 nm. We demonstrate that this method can be used to identify individual HIV particles bound to mammalian cell surfaces. We also apply the method to image microtubule end structures bound to mal3p in fission yeast, and demonstrate that growing microtubule plus-ends are flared in vivo. We localize Rvs167 to endocytic sites in budding yeast, and show that scission takes place halfway through a 10-s time period during which amphiphysins are bound to the vesicle neck. This new technique opens the door for direct correlation of fluorescence and electron microscopy to visualize cellular processes at the ultrastructural scale.},

S. cerevisiae was the yeast best adapted to grow at high temperatures within the Saccharomyces genus, with the highest optimum (32.3°C) and maximum (45.4°C) growth temperatures. On the other hand, S. kudriavzevii and S. bayanus var. uvarum showed the lowest optimum (23.6 and 26.2°C) and maximum (36.8 and 38.4°C) growth temperatures, respectively, confirming that both species are more psychrophilic than S. cerevisiae. The remaining Saccharomyces species (S. paradoxus, S. mikatae, S. arboricolus, and S. cariocanus) showed intermediate responses. With respect to the minimum temperature which supported growth, this parameter ranged from 1.3 (S. cariocanus) to 4.3°C (S. kudriavzevii). We also tested whether these physiological traits were correlated with the phylogeny, which was accomplished by means of a statistical orthogram method. The analysis suggested that the most important shift in the adaptation to grow at higher temperatures occurred in the Saccharomyces genus after the divergence of the S. arboricolus, S. mikatae, S. cariocanus, S. paradoxus, and S. cerevisiae lineages from the S. kudriavzevii and S. bayanus var. uvarum lineages. Finally, our mathematical models suggest that temperature may also play an important role in the imposition of S. cerevisiae versus non-Saccharomyces species during wine fermentation.},

abstract = {SNX33 (sorting nexin 33) is a homologue of the endocytic protein SNX9 and has been implicated in actin polymerization and the endocytosis of the amyloid precursor protein. SNX33 belongs to the large family of BAR (Bin/amphiphysin/Rvs) domain-containing proteins, which alter cellular protein trafficking by modulating cellular membranes and the cytoskeleton. Some BAR domains engage in homodimerization, whereas other BAR domains also mediate heterodimerization between different BAR domain-containing proteins. The molecular basis for this difference is not yet understood. Using co-immunoprecipitations we report that SNX33 forms homodimers, but not heterodimers, with other BAR domain-containing proteins, such as SNX9. Domain deletion analysis revealed that the BAR domain, but not the SH3 (Src homology 3) domain, was required for homodimerization of SNX33. Additionally, the BAR domain prevented the heterodimerization between SNX9 and SNX33, as determined by domain swap experiments. Molecular modelling of the SNX33 BAR domain structure revealed that key amino acids located at the BAR domain dimer interface of the SNX9 homodimer are not conserved in SNX33. Replacing these amino acids in SNX9 with the corresponding amino acids of SNX33 allowed the mutant SNX9 to heterodimerize with SNX33. Taken together, the present study identifies critical amino acids within the BAR domains of SNX9 and SNX33 as determinants for the specificity of BAR domain-mediated interactions and suggests that SNX9 and SNX33 have distinct molecular functions.},

To determine the functional relationship between these proteins and dynamin, we have analyzed endocytic intermediates that accumulate in cells that lack dynamin (derived from dynamin 1 and 2 double conditional knockout mice). In these cells, actin-nucleating proteins, actin, and BAR domain proteins accumulate at the base of arrested endocytic clathrin-coated pits, where they support the growth of dynamic long tubular necks. These results, which we show reflect the sequence of events in wild-type cells, demonstrate a concerted action of these proteins prior to, and independent of, dynamin and emphasize similarities between clathrin-mediated endocytosis in yeast and higher eukaryotes. Our data also demonstrate that the relationship between dynamin and actin is intimately connected to dynamin's endocytic role and that dynamin terminates a powerful actin- and BAR protein-dependent tubulating activity.},

abstract = {Dynamins are a conserved family of proteins involved in membrane fusion and fission. Although mammalian dynamins are known to be involved in several membrane-trafficking events, the role of dynamin-1 in endocytosis is the best-characterised role of this protein family. Despite many similarities between endocytosis in yeast and mammalian cells, a comparable role for dynamins in yeast has not previously been demonstrated. The reported lack of involvement of dynamins in yeast endocytosis has raised questions over the general applicability of the current yeast model of endocytosis, and has also precluded studies using well-developed methods in yeast, to further our understanding of the mechanism of dynamin function during endocytosis. Here, we investigate the yeast dynamin-like protein Vps1 and demonstrate a transient burst of localisation to sites of endocytosis. Using live-cell imaging of endocytic reporters in strains lacking vps1, and also electron microscopy and biochemical approaches, we demonstrate a role for Vps1 in facilitating endocytic invagination. Vps1 mutants were generated, and analysis in several assays reveals a role for the C-terminal self-assembly domain in endocytosis but not in other membrane fission events with which Vps1 has previously been associated.},

Including the effect of interactions in our model has remarkable effects on the uptake characteristics.

In order to understand the role that Cmd1p plays, a search was carried out for possible targets among the genes required for the internalization process. Co-immunoprecipitation, two-hybrid and overlay assays demonstrated that Cmd1p interacts with Myo5p, a type I unconventional myosin. Analysis of the endocytic phenotype and the Cmd1p-Myo5p interaction in thermosensitive cmd1 mutants indicated that the Cmd1p-Myo5p interaction is required for endocytosis in vivo. However, the Cmd1p-Myo5p interaction requirement was partially overcome by deleting the calmodulin binding sites (IQ motifs) from Myo5p, suggesting that these motifs inhibit Myo5p function. Additionally, genetic and biochemical evidence obtained with a collection of cmd1 mutant alleles strongly suggests that Cmd1p plays an additional role in the internalization step of receptor-mediated endocytosis in yeast.},

@article{Ydenberg2013,
abstract = {SummaryBackground
Branched actin filament networks driving cell motility, endocytosis, and intracellular transport are assembled in seconds by the Arp2/3 complex and must be equally rapidly debranched and turned over. One of the only factors known to promote debranching of actin networks is the yeast homolog of glia maturation factor (GMF), which is structurally related to the actin filament-severing protein cofilin. However, the identity of the molecular mechanism underlying debranching and whether this activity extends to mammalian GMF have remained open questions.
Results
Using scanning mutagenesis and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, we show that GMF depends on two separate surfaces for debranching. One is analogous to the G-actin and F-actin binding site on cofilin, but we show using fluorescence anisotropy and chemical crosslinking that it instead interacts with actin-related proteins in the Arp2/3 complex. The other is analogous to a second F-actin binding site on cofilin, which in GMF appears to contact the first actin subunit in the daughter filament. We further show that GMF binds to the Arp2/3 complex with low nanomolar affinity and promotes the open conformation. Finally, we show that this debranching activity and mechanism are conserved for mammalian GMF.
Conclusions
GMF debranches filaments by a mechanism related to cofilin-mediated severing, but in which GMF has evolved to target molecular junctions between actin-related proteins in the Arp2/3 complex and actin subunits in the daughter filament of the branch. This activity and mechanism are conserved in GMF homologs from evolutionarily distant species.},

abstract = {Genetic studies in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe and biochemical data in oocytes and eggs of Xenopus laevis have implicated the product of the cdc2+ gene as critical for the G2 to M transition in the cell cycle. The product of the cdc2+ gene is a 34-kDa serine/threonine protein kinase, designated p34cdc2, that is a component of purified maturation-promoting factor (MPF) and also of purified mammalian growth-associated histone H1 kinase. The biochemical properties of p34cdc2 H1 kinase activity in the MPF complex were studied. Phosphorylation of the p45cyclin component in the MPF complex by p34cdc2 exhibited kinetics consistent with an intramolecular reaction. On glycerol gradient centrifugation, MPF kinase against several substrates sedimented with an apparent Mr = 45,000-55,000. p34cdc2 was found to utilize ATP, GTP, and adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) with apparent Km values of 75, 700, and 250 microM, respectively. The kinase activity was inhibited by beta-glycerophosphate, NaF, and zinc, whereas p-nitrophenyl phosphate was slightly stimulatory. The relative rates of phosphorylation of various substrates by MPF and growth-associated H1 kinase were similar. These findings should prove useful in further work on the regulation of MPF kinase activity and characterization of its substrates.},

abstract = {BAR superfamily domains shape membranes through poorly understood mechanisms. We solved structures of F-BAR modules bound to flat and curved bilayers using electron (cryo)microscopy. We show that membrane tubules form when F-BARs polymerize into helical coats that are held together by lateral and tip-to-tip interactions. On gel-state membranes or after mutation of residues along the lateral interaction surface, F-BARs adsorb onto bilayers via surfaces other than their concave face. We conclude that membrane binding is separable from membrane bending, and that imposition of the module's concave surface forces fluid-phase bilayers to bend locally. Furthermore, exposure of the domain's lateral interaction surface through a change in orientation serves as the crucial trigger for assembly of the helical coat and propagation of bilayer bending. The geometric constraints and sequential assembly of the helical lattice explain how F-BAR and classical BAR domains segregate into distinct microdomains, and provide insight into the spatial regulation of membrane invagination.},

abstract = {It is becoming clear that mechanical stimuli are crucial factors in regulating the biology of the cell, but the short-term structural response of a cell to mechanical forces remains relatively poorly understood. We mechanically stimulated cells transiently expressing actin–EGFP with controlled forces (0–20 nN) in order to investigate the structural response of the cell. Two clear force-dependent responses were observed: a short-term (seconds) local deformation of actin stress fibres and a long-term (minutes) force-induced remodelling of stress fibres at cell edges, far from the point of contact. By photobleaching markers along stress fibres we were also able to quantify strain dynamics occurring along the fibres throughout the cell. The results reveal that the cell exhibits complex heterogeneous negative and positive strain fluctuations along stress fibres in resting cells that indicate localized contraction and stretch dynamics. The application of mechanical force results in the activation of myosin contractile activity reflected in an {\~{}}50{\%} increase in strain fluctuations. This approach has allowed us to directly observe the activation of myosin in response to mechanical force and the effects of cytoskeletal crosslinking on local deformation and strain dynamics. The results demonstrate that force application does not result in simplistic isotropic deformation of the cytoarchitecture, but rather a complex and localized response that is highly dependent on an intact microtubule network. Direct visualization of force-propagation and stress fibre strain dynamics have revealed several crucial phenomena that take place and ultimately govern the downstream response of a cell to a mechanical stimulus.},

Las17p/Bee1p has been shown to be important for actin patch assembly and actin polymerization. Here we show that Las17p interacts with the Arp2/3 complex. LAS17 is an allele-specific multicopy suppressor of ARP2 and ARP3 mutations; overexpression restores both actin patch organization and endocytosis defects in ARP2 temperature-sensitive (ts) cells. Six of seven ARP2 ts mutants and at least one ARP3 ts mutant are synthetically lethal with las17Delta ts confirming functional interaction with the Arp2/3 complex. Further characterization of las17Delta cells showed that receptor-mediated internalization of alpha factor by the Ste2 receptor is severely defective. The polarity of normal bipolar bud site selection is lost. Las17-gfp remains localized in cortical patches in vivo independently of polymerized actin and is required for the polarized localization of Arp2/3 as well as actin. Coimmunoprecipitation of Arp2p with Las17p indicates that Las17p interacts directly with the complex. Two hybrid results also suggest that Las17p interacts with actin, verprolin, Rvs167p and several other proteins including Src homology 3 (SH3) domain proteins, suggesting that Las17p may integrate signals from different regulatory cascades destined for the Arp2/3p complex and the actin cytoskeleton.},

abstract = {Myosin plays an important role in mitosis, especially during cytokinesis. Although it has been assumed that phosphorylation of regulatory light chain of myosin (RLC) controls motility of mammalian non-muscle cells, the functional significance of RLC phosphorylation remains uninvestigated. To address this problem, we have produced unphosphorylatable RLC (T18A/S19A RLC) and overexpressed it in COS-7 cells and normal rat kidney cells. Overexpression of T18A/S19A RLC but not wild type RLC almost completely abolished concanavalin A-induced receptor cap formation. The results indicate that myosin phosphorylation is critical for concanavalin A-induced gathering of surface receptors. T18A/S19A RLC overexpression resulted in the production of multinucleated cells, suggesting the failure of proper cell division in these cells. Video microscopic observation revealed that cells expressing T18A/S19A RLC showed abnormalities during mitosis in two respects. One is that the cells produced abnormal cleavage furrows, resulting in incomplete cytokinesis, which suggests that myosin phosphorylation is important for the normal recruitment of myosin molecules into the contractile ring structure. The other is that separation of chromosomes from the metaphase plate is disrupted in T18A/S19A RLC expressing cells, thus preventing proper transition from metaphase to anaphase. These results suggest that, in addition to cytokinesis, myosin and myosin phosphorylation play a role in the karyokinetic process.},

It has been difficult to observe individual kinetochore–microtubule interactions because multiple kinetochores are captured by microtubules during a short period within a small space. We have developed a method to visualize individual kinetochore–microtubule interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, by isolating one of the kinetochores from others through regulation of the activity of a centromere. We detail this technique, which we call ‘centromere reactivation system', for dissection of the process of kinetochore capture and transport on mitotic spindle. Kinetochores are initially captured by the side of microtubules extending from a spindle pole, and subsequently transported poleward along them, which is an evolutionarily conserved process from yeast to vertebrate cells. Our system, in combination with amenable yeast genetics, has proved useful to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of kinetochore–microtubule interactions. We discuss practical considerations for applying our system to live cell imaging using fluorescence microscopy.},

abstract = {The VPS1 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes an 80-kDa GTPase that associates with Golgi membranes and is required for the sorting of proteins to the yeast vacuole. Vps1p is a member of a growing family of high-molecular-weight GTPases that are found in a number of organisms and are involved in a variety of cellular processes. Vps1p is most similar to mammalian dynamin and the Drosophila Shibire protein, both of which have been shown to play a role in an early step of endocytosis. To identify proteins that interact with Vps1p, a genetic screen was designed to isolate multicopy suppressors of dominant-negative vps1 mutations. One such suppressor, MVP1, that exhibits genetic interaction with VPS1 and is itself required for vacuolar protein sorting has been isolated. Overproduction of Mvp1p will suppress several dominant alleles of VPS1, and suppression is dependent on the presence of wild-type Vps1p. MVP1 encodes a 59-kDa hydrophilic protein, Mvp1p, which appears to colocalize with Vps1p in vps1d and vps27 delta yeast cells. We therefore propose that Mvp1p and Vps1p act in concert to promote membrane traffic to the vacuole.},

abstract = {Recent studies have suggested that the function of the large GTPase dynamin in endocytosis in mammalian cells may comprise a modulation of actin cytoskeleton. The role of dynamin in actin cytoskeleton organization in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has remained undefined. In this report, we found that one of the yeast dynamin-related proteins, Vps1p, is required for normal actin cytoskeleton organization. At both permissive and non-permissive temperatures, the vps1 mutants exhibited various degrees of phenotypes commonly associated with actin cytoskeleton defects: depolarized and aggregated actin structures, hypersensitivity to the actin cytoskeleton toxin latrunculin-A, randomized bud site selection and chitin deposition, and impaired efficiency in the internalization of membrane receptors. Over-expression of the GTPase mutants of vps1 also led to actin abnormalities. Consistent with these actin-related defects, Vps1p was found to interact physically, and partially co-localize, with the actin-regulatory protein Sla1p. The normal cellular localization of Sla1p required Vps1p and could be altered by over-expression of a region of Vps1p that was involved in the interaction with Sla1p. The same region also promoted mis-sorting of the vacuolar protein carboxypeptidase Y upon over-expression. These findings suggest that the functions of the dynamin-related protein Vps1p in actin cytoskeleton dynamics and vacuolar protein sorting are probably related to each other.},

abstract = {The bacterial pathogen, Listeria monocytogenes, grows in the cytoplasm of host cells and spreads intercellularly using a form of actin-based motility mediated by the bacterial protein ActA. Tightly adherent monolayers of MDCK cells that constitutively express GFP-actin were infected with L. monocytogenes, and intercellular spread of bacteria was observed by video microscopy. The probability of formation of membrane-bound protrusions containing bacteria decreased with host cell monolayer age and the establishment of extensive cell-cell contacts. After their extension into a recipient cell, intercellular membrane-bound protrusions underwent a period of bacterium-dependent fitful movement, followed by their collapse into a vacuole and rapid vacuolar lysis. Actin filaments in protrusions exhibited decreased turnover rates compared with bacterially associated cytoplasmic actin comet tails. Recovery of motility in the recipient cell required 1-2 bacterial generations. This delay may be explained by acid-dependent cleavage of ActA by the bacterial metalloprotease, Mpl. Importantly, we have observed that low levels of endocytosis of neighboring MDCK cell surface fragments occurs in the absence of bacteria, implying that intercellular spread of bacteria may exploit an endogenous process of paracytophagy.},

However, the timing of its formation and turnover, and its specific functions at different stages during endocytic internalization, have not been established. In this study, Sla2 ANTH-GFP and Sjl2-3GFP were expressed as functional fusion proteins at endogenous levels to quantitatively explore PtdIns(4,5)P2 dynamics during endocytosis in yeast. Our results indicate that PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels increase and decline in conjunction with coat and actin assembly and disassembly, respectively. Live-cell image analysis of endocytic protein dynamics in an sjl1$\Delta$ sjl2$\Delta$ mutant, which has elevated PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels, revealed that the endocytic machinery is still able to assemble and disassemble dynamically, albeit nonproductively. The defects in the dynamic behavior of the various endocytic proteins in this double mutant suggest that PtdIns(4,5)P2 turnover is required for multiple stages during endocytic vesicle formation. Furthermore, our results indicate that PtdIns(4,5)P2 turnover may act in coordination with the Ark1/Prk1 protein kinases in stimulating disassembly of the endocytic machinery.},

abstract = {The fusion of neurotransmitter-filled vesicles during synaptic transmission is balanced by endocytotic membrane retrieval. Despite extensive research, the speed and mechanisms of synaptic vesicle endocytosis have remained controversial. Here, we establish low-noise time-resolved membrane capacitance measurements that allow monitoring changes in surface membrane area elicited by single action potentials and stronger stimuli with high-temporal resolution at physiological temperature in individual bona-fide mature central synapses. We show that single action potentials trigger very rapid endocytosis, retrieving presynaptic membrane with a time constant of 470 ms. This fast endocytosis is independent of clathrin but mediated by dynamin and actin. In contrast, stronger stimuli evoke a slower mode of endocytosis that is clathrin, dynamin, and actin dependent. Furthermore, the speed of endocytosis is highly temperature dependent with a Q10 of ∼3.5. These results demonstrate that distinct molecular modes of endocytosis with markedly different kinetics operate at central synapses.},

abstract = {Author Summary
Electron microscopy (EM) once revolutionized cell biology by revealing subcellular anatomy at resolutions of tens of nanometers, well below the diffraction limit of light microscopy. Over the past two decades, light microscopy has been revitalized by the development of spontaneously fluorescent proteins, which allow nearly any protein of interest to be specifically tagged by genetic fusion. EM has lacked comparable genetic tags that are generally applicable. Here, we introduce “miniSOG”, a small (106-residue) fluorescent flavoprotein that efficiently generates singlet oxygen when illuminated by blue light. In fixed tissue, photogenerated singlet oxygen locally polymerizes diaminobenzidine into a precipitate that is stainable with osmium and therefore can be readily imaged at high resolution by EM. Thus miniSOG is a versatile label for correlated light and electron microscopy of genetically tagged proteins in cells, tissues, and organisms including intact nematodes and mice. As a demonstration of miniSOG's capabilities, controversies about the localization of synaptic cell adhesion molecules are resolved by EM of miniSOG fusions in neuronal culture and intact mouse brain.},

abstract = {During endocytic vesicle formation, distinct subdomains along the membrane invagination are specified by different proteins, which bend the membrane and drive scission. Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs (BAR) and Fer-CIP4 homology-BAR (F-BAR) proteins can induce membrane curvature and have been suggested to facilitate membrane invagination and scission. Two F-BAR proteins, Syp1 and Bzz1, are found at budding yeast endocytic sites. Syp1 arrives early but departs from the endocytic site before formation of deep membrane invaginations and scission. Using genetic, spatiotemporal, and ultrastructural analyses, we demonstrate that Bzz1, the heterodimeric BAR domain protein Rvs161/167, actin polymerization, and the lipid phosphatase Sjl2 cooperate, each through a distinct mechanism, to induce membrane scission in yeast. Additionally, actin assembly and Rvs161/167 cooperate to drive formation of deep invaginations. Finally, we find that Bzz1, acting at the invagination base, stabilizes endocytic sites and functions with Rvs161/167, localized along the tubule, to achieve proper endocytic membrane geometry necessary for efficient scission. Together, our results reveal that dynamic interplay between a lipid phosphatase, actin assembly, and membrane-sculpting proteins leads to proper membrane shaping, tubule stabilization, and scission.},

Determining the exact mechanisms by which these proteins interact with membranes will be essential to understanding their biological functions.

abstract = {Dual colour total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy is a powerful tool for decoding the molecular dynamics of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). Typically, the recruitment of a fluorescent protein-tagged endocytic protein was referenced to the disappearance of spot-like clathrin-coated structure (CCS), but the precision of spot-like CCS disappearance as a marker for canonical CME remained unknown. Here we have used an imaging assay based on total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to detect scission events with a resolution of ∼ 2 s. We found that scission events engulfed comparable amounts of transferrin receptor cargo at CCSs of different sizes and CCS did not always disappear following scission. We measured the recruitment dynamics of 34 types of endocytic protein to scission events: Abp1, ACK1, amphiphysin1, APPL1, Arp3, BIN1, CALM, CIP4, clathrin light chain (Clc), cofilin, coronin1B, cortactin, dynamin1/2, endophilin2, Eps15, Eps8, epsin2, FBP17, FCHo1/2, GAK, Hip1R, lifeAct, mu2 subunit of the AP2 complex, myosin1E, myosin6, NECAP, N-WASP, OCRL1, Rab5, SNX9, synaptojanin2$\beta$1, and syndapin2. For each protein we aligned ∼ 1,000 recruitment profiles to their respective scission events and constructed characteristic "recruitment signatures" that were grouped, as for yeast, to reveal the modular organization of mammalian CME. A detailed analysis revealed the unanticipated recruitment dynamics of SNX9, FBP17, and CIP4 and showed that the same set of proteins was recruited, in the same order, to scission events at CCSs of different sizes and lifetimes. Collectively these data reveal the fine-grained temporal structure of CME and suggest a simplified canonical model of mammalian CME in which the same core mechanism of CME, involving actin, operates at CCSs of diverse sizes and lifetimes.},

abstract = {Cells actively produce contractile forces for a variety of processes including cytokinesis and motility. Contractility is known to rely on myosin II motors which convert chemical energy from ATP hydrolysis into forces on actin filaments. However, the basic physical principles of cell contractility remain poorly understood. We reconstitute contractility in a simplified model system of purified F-actin, muscle myosin II motors, and $\alpha$-actinin cross-linkers. We show that contractility occurs above a threshold motor concentration and within a window of cross-linker concentrations. We also quantify the pore size of the bundled networks and find contractility to occur at a critical distance between the bundles. We propose a simple mechanism of contraction based on myosin filaments pulling neighboring bundles together into an aggregated structure. Observations of this reconstituted system in both bulk and low-dimensional geometries show that the contracting gels pull on and deform their surface with a contractile force of ∼1 $\mu$N, or ∼100 pN per F-actin bundle. Cytoplasmic extracts contracting in identical environments show a similar behavior and dependence on myosin as the reconstituted system. Our results suggest that cellular contractility can be sensitively regulated by tuning the (local) activity of molecular motors and the cross-linker density and binding affinity.},

abstract = {We used quantitative confocal microscopy to measure the numbers of 16 proteins tagged with fluorescent proteins during assembly and disassembly of endocytic actin patches in fission yeast. The peak numbers of each molecule that accumulate in patches varied {\textless}30-50{\%} between individual patches. The pathway begins with accumulation of 30-40 clathrin molecules, sufficient to build a hemisphere at the tip of a plasma membrane invagination. Thereafter precisely timed waves of proteins reach characteristic peak numbers: endocytic adaptor proteins (approximately 120 End4p and approximately 230 Pan1p), activators of Arp2/3 complex (approximately 200 Wsp1p and approximately 340 Myo1p) and approximately 300 Arp2/3 complexes just ahead of a burst of actin assembly into short, capped and highly cross-linked filaments (approximately 7000 actins, approximately 200 capping proteins, and approximately 900 fimbrins). Coronin arrives last as all other components disperse upon patch internalization and movement over approximately 10 s. Patch internalization occurs without recruitment of dynamins. Mathematical modeling, described in the accompanying paper (Berro et al., 2010, MBoC 21: 2803-2813), shows that the dendritic nucleation hypothesis can account for the time course of actin assembly into a branched network of several hundred filaments 100-200 nm long and that patch disassembly requires actin filament fragmentation in addition to depolymerization from the ends.},

abstract = {Studies using drugs that cause the disassembly of filamentous actin (F-actin) have demonstrated the importance of an intact actin cytoskeleton for polarised secretion by yeast cells [1] and [2]. To address the level of dynamic turnover needed for such processes, however, drugs or mutants that confer stabilising properties on F-actin are needed. Jasplakinolide is the only readily available drug that stabilises F-actin structures both in vivo and in vitro [3], [4], [5] and [6]. Yeast strains have been generated in which two of the ABC multidrug resistance transporter genes have been deleted, rendering normally jasplakinolide-resistant yeast cells sensitive to its effects. Treatment of these cells with jasplakinolide caused rapid and dramatic effects on the actin cytoskeleton, resulting in the accumulation of single large actin structures in cells. These structures, however, still contained components that are normally associated with cortical actin patches. A dynamic actin cytoskeleton was found to be critical for the generation of cell polarity and endocytosis.},

Several of the components required for building these structures are highly conserved between vertebrates and insects (e.g. E-cadherin and alpha- and beta-catenin), while others have so far been found only in invertebrates (e.g. crumbs). Two recent papers(1,2) show that the Drosophila E-cadherin is encoded by the gene shotgun. Phenotypic analyses of shotgun as well as armadillo (beta-catenin) and crumbs mutants provide new insights into the mechanisms by which adherens junctions are built and, further, show that the requirement for E-cadherin largely depends on the morphogenetic activity of an epithelium.},

We solved the structure of the Drosophila amphiphysin BAR domain. It is a crescent-shaped dimer that binds preferentially to highly curved negatively charged membranes. With its N-terminal amphipathic helix and BAR domain (N-BAR), amphiphysin can drive membrane curvature in vitro and in vivo. The structure is similar to that of arfaptin2, which we find also binds and tubulates membranes. From this, we predict that BAR domains are in many protein families, including sorting nexins, centaurins, and oligophrenins. The universal and minimal BAR domain is a dimerization, membrane-binding, and curvature-sensing module.},

@article{Gittes1993a,
abstract = {Microtubules are long, proteinaceous filaments that perform structural functions in eukaryotic cells by defining cellular shape and serving as tracks for intracellular motor proteins. We report the first accurate measurements of the flexural rigidity of microtubules. By analyzing the thermally driven fluctuations in their shape, we estimated the mean flexural rigidity of taxol-stabilized microtubules to be 2.2 x 10(-23) Nm2 (with 6.4{\%} uncertainty) for seven unlabeled microtubules and 2.1 x 10(-23) Nm2 (with 4.7{\%} uncertainty) for eight rhodamine-labeled microtubules. These values are similar to earlier, less precise estimates of microtubule bending stiffness obtained by modeling flagellar motion. A similar analysis on seven rhodamine-phalloidin-labeled actin filaments gave a flexural rigidity of 7.3 x 10(-26) Nm2 (with 6{\%} uncertainty), consistent with previously reported results. The flexural rigidity of these microtubules corresponds to a persistence length of 5,200 microns showing that a microtubule is rigid over cellular dimensions. By contrast, the persistence length of an actin filament is only approximately 17.7 microns, perhaps explaining why actin filaments within cells are usually cross-linked into bundles. The greater flexural rigidity of a microtubule compared to an actin filament mainly derives from the former's larger cross-section. If tubulin were homogeneous and isotropic, then the microtubule's Young's modulus would be approximately 1.2 GPa, similar to Plexiglas and rigid plastics. Microtubules are expected to be almost inextensible: the compliance of cells is due primarily to filament bending or sliding between filaments rather than the stretching of the filaments themselves.},

The procedure begins with the fabrication of embossed microchambers in agarose. Cells are trapped in the chambers by placing a flat, flexible "ceiling", either a slab of agarose or poly(dimethylsiloxane), against an agarose mold on which a suspension of cells has been added; the use of agarose keeps cells hydrated and allows nutrients to diffuse into the chambers. Cells grown in microchambers in the presence of cephalexin grow into a multinucleate, nonseptate, filamentous phenotype and adopt the shape of the microchambers. The resulting cells are motile and can be released by removing the "ceiling" from the agarose microchambers and rinsing the cells into solution.},

abstract = {Summary
Membrane remodeling by BAR (Bin, Amphiphysin, RVS) domain-containing proteins, such as endophilins and amphiphysins, is integral to the process of endocytosis. However, little is known about the regulation of endocytic BAR domain activity. We have identified an interaction between the yeast Rvs167 N-BAR domain and calmodulin. Calmodulin-binding mutants of Rvs167 exhibited defects in endocytic vesicle release. In vitro, calmodulin enhanced membrane tubulation and constriction by wild-type Rvs167 but not calmodulin-binding-defective mutants. A subset of mammalian N-BAR domains bound calmodulin, and co-expression of calmodulin with endophilin A2 potentiated tubulation in vivo. These studies reveal a conserved role for calmodulin in regulating the intrinsic membrane-sculpting activity of endocytic N-BAR domains.},

The highest transformation efficiency was observed when 1 × 108 cells were transformed with 100 ng plasmid DNA in the presence of 50 $\mu$g SS carrier DNA. The yield of transformants increased linearly up to 5 $\mu$g plasmid per transformation. A 20-min heat shock at 42°C was necessary for maximal yields. PEG was found to deposit both carrier DNA and plasmid DNA onto cells. SS carrier DNA bound more effectively to the cells and caused tighter binding of 32P-labelled plasmid DNA than did double-stranded (DS) carrier. The LiAc/SS-DNA/PEG transformation method did not result in cell fusion. DS carrier DNA competed with DS vector DNA in the transformation reaction. SS plasmid DNA transformed cells poorly in combination with both SS and DS carrier DNA. The LiAc/SS-DNA/PEG method was shown to be more effective than other treatments known to make cells transformable. A model for the mechanism of transformation by the LiAc/SS-DNA/PEG method is discussed.},

abstract = {Since the basic outline of the sliding filament mechanism became apparent some 45 years ago, the principal challenge, an experimental one, has been to produce definitive evidence about the detailed molecular mechanisms by which myosin cross-bridges produce force and movement in a muscle. More recently, similar questions could be posed about other molecular motors, in non-muscle cells. This problem proved unexpectedly difficult to solve, in part because of the technical difficulty of obtaining the structural and mechanical information required about rapid events within macromolecules, especially in a working system, and this triggered many remarkable technical developments. There is now very strong evidence for a large change in shape of the myosin heads during ATP hydrolysis, consistent with a lever-arm mechanism. Whether this does indeed provide the driving force for contraction and movement-and, if so, exactly how-and whether some other processes could also play a significant role, is discussed in the light of the experimental and theoretical findings presented at this meeting, and other recent and long-term evidence.},

abstract = {Until recently, the actin cytoskeleton and the endocytic machinery were thought to operate independently. However, the actin cytoskeleton is an integral part of the cell cortex and there is growing evidence in diverse eukaryotes that F-actin plays a direct role during endocytic internalization. Genetic studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae have demonstrated that Arp2/3-mediated F-actin assembly is required specifically for the internalization step of endocytosis. Using real-time image analysis, we recently defined a pathway for receptor-mediated endocytosis in budding yeast. Many features of this pathway appear to be conserved widely, indicating that principles derived from our studies in yeast will be directly applicable in more complex eukaryotes. We are pursuing our yeast studies using a combined approach involving image analysis, functional genomics, proteomics and biochemistry. These ongoing studies are providing a broader and deeper understanding of the molecular events of endocytosis, of how forces for actin polymerization are harnessed, and of how steps in the pathway are regulated. Our studies in mammalian cells provide evidence that this pathway is conserved in more complex organisms for endocytic and Golgi trafficking events.},

abstract = {Endocytosis is a well-conserved process by which cells invaginate small portions of the plasma membrane to create vesicles containing extracellular and transmembrane cargo proteins. Dozens of proteins and hundreds of specific binding interactions are needed to coordinate and regulate these events. Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a powerful model system to study clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). Pan1 is thought to be a scaffolding protein due to its interactions with numerous proteins that act throughout the endocytic process. Previous research has characterized many Pan1 binding interactions, but due to Pan1's essential nature, the exact mechanisms of Pan1's function in endocytosis have been difficult to define. We created a novel Pan1-degron allele, Pan1-AID, in which Pan1 can be specifically and efficiently degraded in less than one hour upon addition of the plant hormone auxin. The loss of Pan1 caused a delay in endocytic progression and weakened connections between the coat/actin machinery and the membrane, leading to an arrest in CME. Additionally, we determined a critical role for the central region of Pan1 in endocytosis and viability. The regions important for endocytosis and viability can be separated suggesting that Pan1 may have a distinct role in the cell that is essential for viability.},

The relative cell volume decrease of exponential cells was found to be greater than the volume decrease of stationary ones during the hyperosmotic shock. The application of a slow and linear increase in osmotic pressure has allowed the distinguishing of two phases in the passive osmoregulatory response of cells and to calculate the turgor pressure ofS. cerevisiae.Cells in the exponential phase have a weak turgor pressure (0.05 MPa) compared to the turgor pressure of stationary phase cells (0.2 MPa).

abstract = {Cell spreading was controlled independently of the amount and density of immobilized integrin ligand by culturing cells on single adhesive islands of different sizes (100–2500 $\mu$m2) and shapes (squares, circles, and lines) or on many smaller (3–5 $\mu$m diameter) circular islands that were coated with a saturating density of fibronectin and separated by non-adhesive regions. The amount of focal adhesions (FAs) containing vinculin and phosphotyrosine increased in direct proportion to cell spreading under all conditions. FAs localized asymmetrically along the periphery of the small islands that experienced highest tensional stress, and FA staining increased when cytoskeletal tension was stimulated with thrombin, whereas inhibitors of contractility promoted FA disassembly. Thus, these findings demonstrate the existence of an “inside-out” mechanism whereby global cell distortion produces increases in cytoskeletal tension that feed back to drive local changes in FA assembly. This complex interplay between cell morphology, mechanics, and adhesion may be critical to how cells integrate from and function in living tissues.},

abstract = {Myosin II-dependent contraction of the contractile ring drives equatorial furrowing during cytokinesis in animal cells. Nonetheless, myosin II-null cells of the cellular slime mold Dictyostelium divide efficiently when adhering to substrates by making use of polar traction forces. Here, we show that in the presence of 30 $\mu$M blebbistatin, a potent myosin II inhibitor, normal rat kidney (NRK) cells adhering to fibronectin-coated surfaces formed equatorial furrows and divided in a manner strikingly similar to myosin II-null Dictyostelium cells. Such blebbistatin-resistant cytokinesis was absent in partially detached NRK cells and was disrupted in adherent cells if the advance of their polar lamellipodia was disturbed by neighboring cells. Y-27632 (40 $\mu$M), which inhibits Rho-kinase, was similar to 30 $\mu$M blebbistatin in that it inhibited cytokinesis of partially detached NRK cells but only prolonged furrow ingression in attached cells. In the presence of 100 $\mu$M blebbistatin, most NRK cells that initiated anaphase formed tight furrows, although scission never occurred. Adherent HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells also formed equatorial furrows efficiently in the presence of 100 $\mu$M blebbistatin. These results provide direct evidence for adhesion-dependent, contractile ring-independent equatorial furrowing in mammalian cells and demonstrate the importance of substrate adhesion for cytokinesis.},

abstract = {The Bin1/amphiphysin/Rvs167 (BAR) domain proteins are a ubiquitous protein family. Genes encoding members of this family have not yet been found in the genomes of prokaryotes, but within eukaryotes, BAR domain proteins are found universally from unicellular eukaryotes such as yeast through to plants, insects, and vertebrates. BAR domain proteins share an N-terminal BAR domain with a high propensity to adopt $\alpha$-helical structure and engage in coiled-coil interactions with other proteins. BAR domain proteins are implicated in processes as fundamental and diverse as fission of synaptic vesicles, cell polarity, endocytosis, regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, transcriptional repression, cell-cell fusion, signal transduction, apoptosis, secretory vesicle fusion, excitation-contraction coupling, learning and memory, tissue differentiation, ion flux across membranes, and tumor suppression. What has been lacking is a molecular understanding of the role of the BAR domain protein in each process. The three-dimensional structure of the BAR domain has now been determined and valuable insight has been gained in understanding the interactions of BAR domains with membranes. The cellular roles of BAR domain proteins, characterized over the past decade in cells as distinct as yeasts, neurons, and myocytes, can now be understood in terms of a fundamental molecular function of all BAR domain proteins: to sense membrane curvature, to bind GTPases, and to mold a diversity of cellular membranes.},

abstract = {The motions of cells and organelles are highly coordinated. They are driven by motor proteins moving along cytoskeletal filaments, and by the dynamic growth and shrinkage of the filaments themselves. The initiation of cellular motility is triggered by biochemical signaling pathways, but the coordination of motility at different locations or times is not well understood. In this review I discuss a new hypothesis that motility is coordinated through mechanical signals passing between and regulating the activity of motors and filaments. The signals are carried by forces and sensed through the acceleration of protein-protein dissociation rates. Mechanical signaling can lead to spontaneous symmetry breaking, switching, and oscillations, and it can account for a wide range of cell motions such as the flagellar beat, mitotic spindle movements, and bidirectional organelle transport. Because forces can propagate quickly, mechanical signaling is ideal for coordinating motion over large distances.},

We systematically examined the dynamic behaviors of endocytic proteins in cells in which Pan1 and End3 were simultaneously eliminated, using the auxin-inducible degron system. The results lead us to propose that endocytic-site initiation and actin assembly are separable processes linked by a Pan1/End3/Sla1 complex.

abstract = {Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is independent of actin dynamics in many circumstances but requires actin polymerization in others. We show that membrane tension determines the actin dependence of clathrin-coat assembly. As found previously, clathrin assembly supports formation of mature coated pits in the absence of actin polymerization on both dorsal and ventral surfaces of non-polarized mammalian cells, and also on basolateral surfaces of polarized cells. Actin engagement is necessary, however, to complete membrane deformation into a coated pit on apical surfaces of polarized cells and, more generally, on the surface of any cell in which the plasma membrane is under tension from osmotic swelling or mechanical stretching. We use these observations to alter actin dependence experimentally and show that resistance of the membrane to propagation of the clathrin lattice determines the distinction between 'actin dependent and 'actin independent'. We also find that light-chain-bound Hip1R mediates actin engagement. These data thus provide a unifying explanation for the role of actin dynamics in coated-pit budding.},

This synthetic lethality is allele-specific regarding the act1 mutations, pointing to a region on the actin molecule where contacts with the myosin head have been described. The possible involvement of a myosin in a vital function fulfilled both by the Rvsp proteins and actin is strengthened further by the fact that the double mutants rvs167, myo1 and rvs167, myo2 are lethal and severely affected in growth respectively.

abstract = {Dynamin, a crucial factor in endocytosis, is a member of a family of GTPases that participates in membrane fission. It was initially proposed to act as a machine that constricts and cuts the neck of nascent vesicles in a GTP-hydrolysis-dependent reaction, but subsequent studies suggested alternative models. Here we monitored the effect of nucleotides on dynamin-coated lipid tubules in real time. Addition of GTP, but not of GDP or GTP-$\gamma$S, resulted in twisting of the tubules and supercoiling, suggesting a rotatory movement of the helix turns relative to each other during GTP hydrolysis. Rotation was confirmed by the movement of beads attached to the tubules. Twisting activity produced a longitudinal tension that was released by tubule breakage when both ends of the tubule were anchored. Fission also occurred when dynamin and GTP were added to lipid tubules that had been generated from liposomes by the motor activity of kinesin on microtubules. No fission events were observed in the absence of longitudinal tension. These findings demonstrate a mechanoenzyme activity of dynamin in endocytosis, but also imply that constriction is not sufficient for fission. At the short necks of endocytic vesicles, other factors leading to tension may cooperate with the constricting activity of dynamin to induce fission.},

abstract = {Contractile actin cortex is involved in cell morphogenesis, movement, and cytokinesis, but its organization and assembly are poorly understood. During blebbing, the membrane detaches from the cortex and inflates. As expansion ceases, contractile cortex reassembles under the membrane and drives bleb retraction. This cycle enabled us to measure the temporal sequence of protein recruitment to the membrane during cortex reassembly and to explore dependency relationships. Expanding blebs were devoid of actin, but proteins of the erythrocytic submembranous cytoskeleton were present. When expansion ceased, ezrin was recruited to the membrane first, followed by actin, actin-bundling proteins, and, finally, contractile proteins. Complete assembly of the contractile cortex, which was organized into a cagelike mesh of filaments, took ∼30 s. Cytochalasin D blocked recruitment of actin and $\alpha$-actinin, but had no effect on membrane association of ankyrin B and ezrin. Ezrin played no role in actin nucleation, but was essential for tethering the membrane to the cortex. The Rho pathway was important for cortex assembly in blebs.},

abstract = {The pathogenic bacterium Listeria monocytogenes is capable of directed movement within the cytoplasm of infected host cells. Propulsion is thought to be driven by actin polymerization at the bacterial cell surface, and moving bacteria leave in their wake a tail of actin filaments. Determining the mechanism by which L. monocytogenes polymerizes actin may aid the understanding of how actin polymerization is controlled in the cell. Actin assembly by L. monocytogenes requires the bacterial surface protein ActA and protein components present in host cell cytoplasm. We have purified an eight-polypeptide complex that possesses the properties of the host-cell actin polymerization factor. The pure complex is sufficient to initiate ActA-dependent actin polymerization at the surface of L. monocytogenes, and is required to mediate actin tail formation and motility. Two subunits of this protein complex are actin-related proteins (ARPs) belonging to the Arp2 and Arp3 subfamilies. The Arp3 subunit localizes to the surface of stationary bacteria and the tails of motile bacteria in tissue culture cells infected with L. monocytogenes; this is consistent with a role for the complex in promoting actin assembly in vivo. The activity and subunit composition of the Arp2/3 complex suggests that it forms a template that nucleates actin polymerization.},

abstract = {The fusion of neurotransmitter-filled vesicles during synaptic transmission is balanced by endocytotic membrane retrieval. Despite extensive research, the speed and mechanisms of synaptic vesicle endocytosis have remained controversial. Here, we establish low-noise time-resolved membrane capacitance measurements that allow monitoring changes in surface membrane area elicited by single action potentials and stronger stimuli with high-temporal resolution at physiological temperature in individual bona-fide mature central synapses. We show that single action potentials trigger very rapid endocytosis, retrieving presynaptic membrane with a time constant of 470 ms. This fast endocytosis is independent of clathrin but mediated by dynamin and actin. In contrast, stronger stimuli evoke a slower mode of endocytosis that is clathrin, dynamin, and actin dependent. Furthermore, the speed of endocytosis is highly temperature dependent with a Q10 of ∼3.5. These results demonstrate that distinct molecular modes of endocytosis with markedly different kinetics operate at central synapses.},

abstract = {In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the WASP (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein) homologue Las17p (also called Bee1p) is an important component of cortical actin patches. Las17p is part of a high-molecular-weight protein complex that regulates Arp2/3 complex-dependent actin polymerization at the cell cortex and that includes the type I myosins Myo3p and Myo5p and verprolin (Vrp1p). To identify other factors implicated with this complex in actin regulation, we isolated proteins that bind to Las17p by two-hybrid screening and affinity chromatography. Here, we report the characterization of Lsb7/Bzz1p (for Las seventeen binding protein 7), an Src homology 3 (SH3) domain protein that interacts directly with Las17p via a polyproline-SH3 interaction. Bzz1p coimmunoprecipitates in a complex with Las17p, Vrp1p, Myo3/5p, Bbc1p, Hsp70p, and actin. It colocalizes with cortical actin patches and with Las17p. This localization is dependent on Las17p, but not on F-actin. Bzz1p interacts physically and genetically with type I myosins. While deletion of BZZ1 shows no obvious phenotype, simultaneous deletion of the BZZ1, MYO3, and MYO5 genes is lethal. Overexpression of Bzz1p inhibits cell growth, and a bzz1$\Delta$ myo5$\Delta$ double mutant is unable to restore actin polarity after NaCl stress. Finally, Bzz1p in vitro is able to recruit a functional actin polymerization machinery through its SH3 domains. Its interactions with Las17p, Vrp1p, and the type I myosins are essential for this process. This suggests that Bzz1p could be implicated in the regulation of actin polymerization.},

abstract = {Mammalian dynamin is responsible for scission of endocytic vesicles from the plasma membrane. A previous study showed that Vps1, a yeast dynamin-like protein, plays an important role in pheromone receptor internalization (Yu and Cai, 2004; J. Cell Sci. 117, 3839-3853). However, the details of how Vps1 acts in various phases of endocytosis including early internalization of the endocytic vesicle are poorly understood. To investigate the potential roles of Vps1 in both endocytic vesicle formation/maturation on the plasma membrane and endocytic vesicle internalization, time-lapse fluorescent images of GFP-tagged endocytic markers in live cells were analyzed using a particle tracking software. The loss of Vps1 leads to a robust increase in the lifespan of newly forming cortical endocytic vesicles carrying Las17-GFP, Ede1-GFP, Sla1-GFP, and Abp1-GFP, indicating that Vps1 is required for the proper assembly and maturation of endocytic vesicles. Particle track analysis revealed that Abp1-GFP vesicles in vps1 null cells moved a relatively short distance away from the cell membrane due to their non-directional movement. Furthermore, we found that the GTPase and the GED domains of Vps1 are required for the proper endocytic function of Vps1. Our tracking analysis data also revealed that the post-internalized vesicle motility en route to the vacuole was decreased significantly, perhaps due to severe disruption of the actin cables in Vps1 mutant cells.},

However, the timing of its formation and turnover, and its specific functions at different stages during endocytic internalization, have not been established. In this study, Sla2 ANTH-GFP and Sjl2-3GFP were expressed as functional fusion proteins at endogenous levels to quantitatively explore PtdIns(4,5)P2 dynamics during endocytosis in yeast. Our results indicate that PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels increase and decline in conjunction with coat and actin assembly and disassembly, respectively. Live-cell image analysis of endocytic protein dynamics in an sjl1$\Delta$ sjl2$\Delta$ mutant, which has elevated PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels, revealed that the endocytic machinery is still able to assemble and disassemble dynamically, albeit nonproductively. The defects in the dynamic behavior of the various endocytic proteins in this double mutant suggest that PtdIns(4,5)P2 turnover is required for multiple stages during endocytic vesicle formation. Furthermore, our results indicate that PtdIns(4,5)P2 turnover may act in coordination with the Ark1/Prk1 protein kinases in stimulating disassembly of the endocytic machinery.},

abstract = {Morphological changes during cell division in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are controlled by cell-cycle regulators. The Pcl-Pho85p kinase complex has been implicated in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton at least in part through Rvs167p. Rvs167p consists of three domains called BAR, GPA, and SH3. Using a two-hybrid assay, we demonstrated that each region of Rvs167p participates in protein-protein interactions: the BAR domain bound the BAR domain of another Rvs167p protein and that of Rvs161p, the GPA region bound Pcl2p, and the SH3 domain bound Abp1p. We identified Rvs167p as a Las17p/Bee1p-interacting protein in a two-hybrid screen and showed that Las17p/Bee1p bound the SH3 domain of Rvs167p. We tested the extent to which the Rvs167p protein domains rescued phenotypes associated with deletion of RVS167: salt sensitivity, random budding, and endocytosis and sporulation defects. The BAR domain was sufficient for full or partial rescue of all rvs167 mutant phenotypes tested but not required for the sporulation defect for which the SH3 domain was also sufficient. Overexpression of Rvs167p inhibits cell growth. The BAR domain was essential for this inhibition and the SH3 domain had only a minor effect. Rvs167p may link the cell cycle regulator Pcl-Pho85p kinase and the actin cytoskeleton. We propose that Rvs167p is activated by phosphorylation in its GPA region by the Pcl-Pho85p kinase. Upon activation, Rvs167p enters a multiprotein complex, making critical contacts in its BAR domain and redundant or minor contacts with its SH3 domain.},

Electron microscopic preparation techniques based on rapid cryofixation (without cryoprotectants) were used. The intramembraneous aspects of the plasma membrane were described by freeze fracturing. For the first time the dynamic surface structures could be directly analyzed by freeze drying in the scanning electron microscope and in thin section of freeze substituted samples. This preparation techniques reveal hair-like structures on the surface of yeast cells. The hairs of cells grown in the rich medium are longer than those grown in the minimal medium. A mutant defective in the structure of a cell surface galactomannoprotein (acid phosphatase) reveals (under conditions of maximal acid phosphatase expression) a cell surface structure that differs from the wild type. It is likely that the hairs represent the peripheral galactomannan layer or part of it. On the membrane fracture faces the number, shape, distribution and state of aggregation of the intramembraneous particles are different between membranes of growing and non-growing cells and between cells grown under different physiological conditions. In the minimal medium corresponding periodical structures on the plasmic and exoplasmic fracture faces were observed, which clearly differ between exponential and stationary phase cells. The number, length and depth of plasma membrane invaginations increase as the cells go from the exponential phase to the stationary phase.

However, regulatory mechanisms controlling these interactions are poorly understood. Here, we show that Drosophila Nervous Wreck (Nwk) is autoregulated by a C-terminal SH3 domain module that interacts directly with its F-BAR domain. Surprisingly, this autoregulation does not mediate a simple "on-off" switch for membrane remodeling. Instead, the isolated Nwk F-BAR domain efficiently assembles into higher-order structures and deforms membranes only within a limited range of negative membrane charge, and autoregulation elevates this range. Thus, autoregulation could either reduce membrane binding or promote higher-order assembly, depending on local cellular membrane composition. Our findings uncover an unexpected mechanism by which lipid composition directs membrane remodeling.},

abstract = {Back to TopAbstract
Intracellular and extracellular mechanical forces affect the structure and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton. However, the underlying molecular and biophysical mechanisms, including how mechanical forces are sensed, are largely unknown. Actin-depolymerizing factor/cofilin proteins are actin-modulating proteins that are ubiquitously distributed in eukaryotes, and they are the most likely candidate as proteins to drive stress fiber disassembly in response to changes in tension in the fiber. In this study, we propose a novel hypothesis that tension in an actin filament prevents the filament from being severed by cofilin. To test this, we placed single actin filaments under tension using optical tweezers. When a fiber was tensed, it was severed after the application of cofilin with a significantly larger delay in comparison with control filaments suspended in solution. The binding rate of cofilin to an actin bundle decreased when the bundle was tensed. These results suggest that tension in an actin filament reduces the cofilin binding, resulting in a decrease in its effective severing activity.},

abstract = {Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P₂] plays a fundamental role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. However, precisely how PI(4,5)P₂ metabolism is spatially and temporally regulated during membrane internalization and the functional consequences of endocytosis-coupled PI(4,5)P₂ dephosphorylation remain to be explored. Using cell-free assays with liposomes of varying diameters, we show that the major synaptic phosphoinositide phosphatase, synaptojanin 1 (Synj1), acts with membrane curvature generators/sensors, such as the BAR protein endophilin, to preferentially remove PI(4,5)P₂ from curved membranes as opposed to relatively flat ones. Moreover, in vivo recruitment of Synj1's inositol 5-phosphatase domain to endophilin-induced membrane tubules results in fragmentation and condensation of these structures largely in a dynamin-dependent fashion. Our study raises the possibility that geometry-based mechanisms may contribute to spatially restricting PI(4,5)P₂ elimination during membrane internalization and suggests that the PI(4,5)P₂-to-PI4P conversion achieved by Synj1 at sites of high curvature may cooperate with dynamin to achieve membrane fission.},

The tracks behind the beads show characteristic differences in shape and curvature from those left by the bacteria, which have an elongated shape and a similar polymerization-inducing enzyme distributed only on the rear surface of the cell. The experimental tracks are simulated using a generalized kinematic model, which incorporates three modes of bead rotation with respect to the tail. The results show that the trajectories of spherical beads are mechanically deterministic rather than random, as suggested by stochastic models. Assessment of the bead rotation and its mechanistic basis offers insights into the biological function of actin-based motility.},

abstract = {Traction force generated at focal adhesions (FAs) of cells plays an essential role in regulating cellular functions. However, little is known about how the traction force at each FA changes during cell stretching. Here we investigated dynamic changes in traction force at FAs during macroscopic stretching of porcine aortic smooth muscle cells (SMCs) cultured on elastic micropillar substrates. SMCs were cultured on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based substrates with a micropillar array, and stretched approximately in the direction of their major axis and then released by stretching and relaxing the substrates. This stretch–release cycle was repeated twice with cell strain rates of 0.3{\%}/15 s up to a 3{\%} strain, and the deflection of the PDMS micropillars was measured simultaneously to obtain the traction force at each FA F, total force in the cell's major axis direction Fall, and whole-cell strain $\epsilon$cell. Traction forces of SMCs during stretching varied widely with location: their changes at some pillars synchronized well with the applied strain $\epsilon$cell, but others did not synchronized. Whole-cell stiffness estimated as the slope of the loading limb of the Fall–$\epsilon$cell curves was ∼10 nN/{\%}, which was the same order of magnitude of the reported stiffness of cultured SMCs obtained in a tensile test. Interestingly, Fall at a zero-strain state (pretension at the whole-cell level) actively increased in some cells following the loading/unloading process, as did whole-cell stiffness. Such a change did not occur in cultured SMCs in the tensile test in which cells were held with a pair of micropipettes coated with nonspecific adhesive. These results indicate that SMCs showed a myogenic response when stretched through their multiple FAs, but not through nonspecific adhesions on their membrane. SMCs may behave differently depending on the sites through which they are stretched.},

abstract = {Cellular activities such as endocytosis and secretion require that cargos actively switch between the microtubule (MT) and actin filament (AF) networks. Cellular studies suggest that switching may involve a tug of war or coordinate regulation of MT- and AF-based motor function.
To test the hypothesis that motor number can be used to direct the outcome of a tug-of-war process, we reconstituted cargo switching at MT-AF intersections in a minimal system with purified myosin V and dynein-dynactin motors bound to beads. Beads containing both motors often paused at the intersections and rotated about an axis perpendicular to both filaments, suggesting that competing motors apply a torque on their cargo. Force measurements showed that motor forces scale with the number of engaged myosin V and dynein-dynactin motors. Whether beads remained on a MT or AF or switched to the alternate track was determined by which set of motors collectively produced greater force. Passing and switching probabilities were similar whether the bead approached an intersection on either a MT or an AF. Beads with a force ratio near unity had approximately equal probabilities of exiting on the MT, exiting on the AF, or remaining stalled at the intersection. A simple statistical model quantitatively describes the relationship between switching probability and motor number.
Cargo switching can be tuned via combinations of 1–4 myosin V and 1–4 dynein-dynactin engaged motors through a simple force-mediated mechanism.},

abstract = {Recently, a pathway involving the highly choreographed recruitment of endocytic proteins to sites of clathrin/actin-mediated endocytosis has been revealed in budding yeast. Here, we investigated possible roles for candidate disassembly factors in regulation of the dynamics of the endocytic coat proteins Sla2p, Ent1p, Ent2p, Sla1p, Pan1p and End3p, each of which has mammalian homologues. Live cell imaging analysis revealed that in addition to the synaptojanin, Sjl2p, the Ark1p and Prk1p protein kinases, the putative Arf GTPase-activating protein, Gts1p and the Arf GTPase-interacting protein, Lsb5p, also arrive at endocytic sites late in the internalization pathway, consistent with roles in coat disassembly. Analysis of coat dynamics in various mutant backgrounds revealed that multiple pathways, including the ones mediated by an Arf guanosine triphosphatase and a synaptojanin, facilitate efficient disassembly of different endocytic coat proteins. In total, at least four separate processes are important for disassembly of endocytic complexes and efficient downstream trafficking of endocytic cargo.},

@article{Azoury2008,
abstract = {Female meiosis in higher organisms consists of highly asymmetric divisions, which retain most maternal stores in the oocyte for embryo development. Asymmetric partitioning of the cytoplasm results from the spindle's "off-center" positioning, which, in mouse oocytes, depends mainly on actin filaments [1, 2]. This is a unique situation compared to most systems, in which spindle positioning requires interactions between astral microtubules and cortical actin filaments [3]. Formin 2, a straight-actin-filament nucleator, is required for the first meiotic spindle migration to the cortex and cytokinesis in mouse oocytes [4, 5]. Although the requirement for actin filaments in the control of spindle positioning is well established in this model, no one has been able to detect them in the cytoplasm [6]. Through the expression of an F-actin-specific probe and live confocal microscopy, we show the presence of a cytoplasmic actin meshwork, organized by Formin 2, that controls spindle migration. In late meiosis I, these filaments organize into a spindle-like F-actin structure, which is connected to the cortex. At anaphase, global reorganization of this meshwork allows polar-body extrusion. In addition, using actin-YFP, our FRAP analysis confirms the presence of a highly dynamic cytoplasmic actin meshwork that is tightly regulated in time and space.},

abstract = {Cellular myosin II is the principal motor responsible for cytokinesis. In higher eukaryotes, phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain (MLC) of myosin II is a primary means of activating myosin II and is known to be crucial for the execution of cell division. Because signals transmitted by the mitotic spindle coordinate key spatial and temporal aspects of cytokinesis, such signals should ultimately function to activate myosin II. Thus, it follows that identification of regulatory factors involved in MLC phosphorylation should elucidate the nature of spindle-derived regulatory signals and lead to a model for how they control cytokinesis. However, the identity of these upstream molecules remains elusive. This review (which is part of the Cytokinesis series) summarizes current views of the regulatory pathway controlling MLC phosphorylation and features four candidate molecules that are likely immediate upstream myosin regulators. I discuss proposed functions for MLCK, ROCK, citron kinase and myosin phosphatase during cytokinesis and consider the possibility of a link between these molecules and the signals transmitted by the mitotic spindle.},

abstract = {Five points are discussed regarding the vesicular structure isolated by fractionation techniques from the brain and liver of the guinea pig. 1. One type of vesicle, fixed by OsO(4) and shown in thin sections, is identified with the coated vesicle that has been observed in many varieties of tissues. 2. The vesicle contained in a spherical polygonal "basketwork" shown by the negative-staining techniques is identical with the coated vesicle shown in sections. 3. Despite minute observation of this basketwork we could not confirm the existence of "hairlike projections" extending from the convex cytoplasmic surface of the vesicle. We are inclined to believe, therefore, that the hairlike projections are actually the superimposed visual images of the regular hexagons and pentagons of the network composing the basketwork. 4. We repeat the hypothesis originally advanced by Roth and Porter (1) that the "coating" of the coated vesicle plays a role in the mechanism of the infolding and fission of the membrane; we suggest that these events are caused by the transformation of the regular hexagons (of the coating) into regular pentagons. 5. Finally, we make a suggestion as to the nature of those vesicles which have on their surface subparticles which look like "elementary particles (2)."},

abstract = {More than 60 highly conserved proteins appear sequentially at sites of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in yeast and mammals. The yeast Eps15-related proteins Pan1 and End3 and the CIN85-related protein Sla1 are known to interact with each other in vitro, and they all appear after endocytic-site initiation but before endocytic actin assembly, which facilitates membrane invagination/scission. Here we used live-cell imaging in parallel with genetics and biochemistry to explore comprehensively the dynamic interactions and functions of Pan1, End3, and Sla1. Our results indicate that Pan1 and End3 associate in a stable manner and appear at endocytic sites before Sla1. The End3 C-terminus is necessary and sufficient for its cortical localization via interaction with Pan1, whereas the End3 N-terminus plays a crucial role in Sla1 recruitment. We systematically examined the dynamic behaviors of endocytic proteins in cells in which Pan1 and End3 were simultaneously eliminated, using the auxin-inducible degron system. The results lead us to propose that endocytic-site initiation and actin assembly are separable processes linked by a Pan1/End3/Sla1 complex. Finally, our study provides mechanistic insights into how Pan1 and End3 function with Sla1 to coordinate cargo capture with actin assembly.},

abstract = {To explore the conservation of Src homology 3 (SH3) domain-mediated networks in evolution, we compared the specificity landscape of these domains among four yeast species, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Ashbya gossypii, Candida albicans, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, encompassing 400 million years of evolution. We first aligned and catalogued the families of SH3-containing proteins in these four species to determine the relationships between homologous domains. Then, we tagged and purified all soluble SH3 domains (82 in total) to perform a quantitative peptide assay (SPOT) for each SH3 domain. All SPOT readouts were hierarchically clustered and we observed that the organization of the SH3 specificity landscape in three distinct profile classes remains conserved across these four yeast species. We also produced a specificity profile for each SH3 domain from manually aligned top SPOT hits and compared the within-family binding motif consensus. This analysis revealed a striking example of binding motif divergence in a C. albicans Rvs167 paralog, which cannot be explained by overall SH3 sequence or interface residue divergence, and we validated this specificity change with a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assay. In addition, we show that position-weighted matrices (PWM) compiled from SPOT assays can be used for binding motif screening in potential binding partners and present cases where motifs are either conserved or lost among homologous SH3 interacting proteins. Finally, by comparing pairwise SH3 sequence identity to binding profile correlation we show that for {\~{}}75{\%} of all analyzed families the SH3 specificity profile was remarkably conserved over a large evolutionary distance. Thus, a high sequence identity within an SH3 domain family predicts conserved binding specificity, whereas divergence in sequence identity often coincided with a change in binding specificity within this family. As such, our results are important for future studies aimed at unraveling complex specificity networks of peptide recognition domains in higher eukaryotes, including mammals.},

abstract = {Phosphoinositides (PI) are synthesized and turned over by specific kinases, phosphatases, and lipases that ensure the proper localization of discrete PI isoforms at distinct membranes. We analyzed the role of the yeast synaptojanin-like proteins using a strain that expressed only a temperature-conditional allele of SJL2. Our analysis demonstrated that inactivation of the yeast synaptojanins leads to increased cellular levels of phosphatidylinositol (3,5)-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2), accompanied by defects in actin organization, endocytosis, and clathrin-mediated sorting between the Golgi and endosomes. The phenotypes observed in synaptojanin-deficient cells correlated with accumulation of PtdIns(4,5)P2, because these effects were rescued by mutations in MSS4 or a mutant form of Sjl2p that harbors only PI 5-phosphatase activity. We utilized green fluorescent protein-pleckstrin homology domain chimeras (termed FLAREs for fluorescent lipid-associated reporters) with distinct PI-binding specificities to visualize pools of PtdIns(4,5)P2 and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate in yeast. PtdIns(4,5)P2 localized to the plasma membrane in a manner dependent on Mss4p activity. On inactivation of the yeast synaptojanins, PtdIns(4,5)P2 accumulated in intracellular compartments, as well as the cell surface. In contrast, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate generated by Pik1p localized in intracellular compartments. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the yeast synaptojanins control the localization of PtdIns(4,5)P2 in vivo and provide further evidence for the compartmentalization of different PI species.},

However, the resolution of these studies is insufficient to unveil how the endocytic machinery actually drives membrane deformation in vivo. In this study, we use quantitative immuno-EM to introduce the temporal dimension to the ultrastructural analysis of membrane budding and define changes in the topography of the lipid bilayer coupled to the dynamics of endocytic proteins with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution. Using this approach, we frame the emergence of membrane curvature with respect to the recruitment of endocytic factors and show that constriction of the invaginations correlates with translocation of membrane-sculpting proteins. Furthermore, we show that initial bending of the plasma membrane is independent of actin and clathrin polymerization and precedes building of an actin cap branched by the Arp2/3 complex. Finally, our data indicate that constriction and additional elongation of the endocytic profiles require the mechanochemical activity of the myosins-I. Altogether, this work provides major insights into the molecular mechanisms driving membrane deformation in a cellular context.},

abstract = {Shallow hydrophobic insertions and crescent-shaped BAR scaffolds promote membrane curvature. Here, we investigate membrane fission by shallow hydrophobic insertions quantitatively and mechanistically. We provide evidence that membrane insertion of the ENTH domain of epsin leads to liposome vesiculation, and that epsin is required for clathrin-coated vesicle budding in cells. We also show that BAR-domain scaffolds from endophilin, amphiphysin, GRAF, and $\beta$2-centaurin limit membrane fission driven by hydrophobic insertions. A quantitative assay for vesiculation reveals an antagonistic relationship between amphipathic helices and scaffolds of N-BAR domains in fission. The extent of vesiculation by these proteins and vesicle size depend on the number and length of amphipathic helices per BAR domain, in accord with theoretical considerations. This fission mechanism gives a new framework for understanding membrane scission in the absence of mechanoenzymes such as dynamin and suggests how Arf and Sar proteins work in vesicle scission., Shallow hydrophobic deformations of a membrane by amphipathic helices not only cause changes in curvature but also drive complete fission. This reaction is limited by BAR domains that are often found in the same proteins with amphipathic helices, suggesting that in vivo the propensity for a membrane to vesiculate can be regulated by a combinatory effect associated with protein domains.},

abstract = {We have screened a large tomato EST database against the Arabidopsis genomic sequence and report here the identification of a set of 1025 genes (referred to as a conserved ortholog set, or COS markers) that are single or low copy in both genomes (as determined by computational screens and DNA gel blot hybridization) and that have remained relatively stable in sequence since the early radiation of dicotyledonous plants. These genes were annotated, and a large portion could be assigned to putative functional categories associated with basic metabolic processes, such as energy-generating processes and the biosynthesis and degradation of cellular building blocks. We further demonstrate, through computational screens (e.g., against a Medicago truncatula database) and direct hybridization on genomic DNA of diverse plant species, that these COS markers also are conserved in the genomes of other plant families. Finally, we show that this gene set can be used for comparative mapping studies between highly divergent genomes such as those of tomato and Arabidopsis. This set of COS markers, identified computationally and experimentally, may further studies on comparative genomes and phylogenetics and elucidate the nature of genes conserved throughout plant evolution.},

@article{Raths1993,
abstract = {alpha-factor, one of two peptide hormones responsible for synchronized mating between MATa and MAT alpha-cell types in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, binds to its cell surface receptor and is internalized in a time-, temperature-, and energy-dependent manner (Chvatchko, Y., I. Howald, and H. Riezman. 1986. Cell. 46:355-364). After internalization, alpha-factor is delivered to the vacuole via vesicular intermediates and degraded there consistent with an endocytic mechanism (Singer, B., and H. Riezman. 1990. J. Cell Biol. 110:1911-1922; Chvatchko, Y., I. Howald, and H. Riezman. 1986. Cell. 46:355-364). We have isolated two mutants that are defective in the internalization process. Both mutations confer a recessive, temperature-sensitive growth phenotype upon cells that cosegregates with their endocytosis defect. Lucifer yellow, a marker for fluid-phase endocytosis, shows accumulation characteristics in the mutants that are similar to the uptake characteristics of 35S-alpha-factor. The endocytic defect in end4 cells appears immediately upon shift to restrictive temperature and is reversible at permissive temperature if new protein synthesis is allowed. Furthermore, the end4 mutation only affects alpha-factor internalization and not the later delivery of alpha-factor to the vacuole. Other vesicle-mediated processes seem to be normal in end3 and end4 mutants. END3 and END4 are the first genes shown to be necessary for the internalization step of receptor-borne and fluid-phase markers in yeast.},

abstract = {We have used comprehensive synthetic lethal screens and biochemical assays to examine the biological role of the yeast amphiphysin homologues Rvs161p and Rvs167p, two proteins that play a role in regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, endocytosis, and sporulation. We found that unlike some forms of amphiphysin, Rvs161p-Rvs167p acts as an obligate heterodimer during vegetative growth and neither Rvs161p nor Rvs167p forms a homodimer in vivo. RVS161 and RVS167 have an identical set of 49 synthetic lethal interactions, revealing functions for the Rvs proteins in cell polarity, cell wall synthesis, and vesicle trafficking as well as a shared role in mating. Consistent with these roles, we show that the Rvs167p-Rvs161p heterodimer, like its amphiphysin homologues, can bind to phospholipid membranes in vitro, suggesting a role in vesicle formation and/or fusion. Our genetic screens also reveal that the interaction between Abp1p and the Rvs167p Src homology 3 (SH3) domain may be important under certain conditions, providing the first genetic evidence for a role for the SH3 domain of Rvs167p. Our studies implicate heterodimerization of amphiphysin family proteins in various functions related to cell polarity, cell integrity, and vesicle trafficking during vegetative growth and the mating response.},

abstract = {Lipids and several specialized proteins are thought to be able to sense the curvature of membranes (MC). Here we used quantitative fluorescence microscopy to measure curvature-selective binding of amphipathic motifs on single liposomes 50–700 nm in diameter. Our results revealed that sensing is predominantly mediated by a higher density of binding sites on curved membranes instead of higher affinity. We proposed a model based on curvature-induced defects in lipid packing that related these findings to lipid sorting and accurately predicted the existence of a new ubiquitous class of curvature sensors: membrane-anchored proteins. The fact that unrelated structural motifs such as $\alpha$-helices and alkyl chains sense MC led us to propose that MC sensing is a generic property of curved membranes rather than a property of the anchoring molecules. We therefore anticipate that MC will promote the redistribution of proteins that are anchored in membranes through other types of hydrophobic moieties.},

PCC 6803 was challenged by salt (NaCl), and the osmolytes sorbitol and maltose. The physiological response towards each of the three compounds was found to be different. After salt addition, the cell volume remained unchanged, and the accumulation of the osmoprotective compound glucosylglycerol (GG) was observed after activation of the key enzyme GgpS at the biochemical and gene (ggpS) expression level. Sorbitol addition had only minor effects on the cell volume. In spite of the fact that the ggpS expression was increased, the GgpS enzyme was not activated, resulting in the absence of GG accumulation. In contrast the cells accumulated sorbitol, which served as a compatible solute and assured a certain osmotic resistance. In comparison to NaCl and sorbitol, the addition of maltose caused a strong decrease in cell volume indicating water efflux. However, no osmolyte accumulation was observed, resulting in an osmosensitive phenotype. Consequently, a successful response of Synechocystis cells to an osmotic challenge is indicative of the de novo synthesis of GG upon salt-dependent activation of the GgpS enzyme or the uptake of external solutes.},

Formation of tubes or buds from a nearly flat membrane is a widely spread feature of the membrane shape changes. The BAR (Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs-homology) domain dimers exhibit long extended curved shapes and appear to be outstandingly suitable modules for this purpose. So far, crystal structures of 18 independent BAR domains including inverse-BAR domains and FCH-BAR domains have been reported. These atomic models show a vast variation of dimer shapes on a common and simple basic framework. Comparison of the structural variations with respect to differences in membrane sculpting properties provide useful clues about the mechanisms for modifying the framework into a particular dimer that generates and/or senses a distinct curvature set of the membrane. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Actin-based contractility orchestrates changes in cell shape underlying cellular functions ranging from division to migration and wound healing. Actin also functions in intracellular transport, with the prevailing view that filamentous actin (F-actin) cables serve as tracks for motor-driven transport of cargo. We recently discovered an alternate mode of intracellular transport in starfish oocytes involving a contractile F-actin meshwork that mediates chromosome congression. The mechanisms by which this meshwork contracts and translates its contractile activity into directional transport of chromosomes remained open questions. Here, we use live-cell imaging with quantitative analysis of chromosome trajectories and meshwork velocities to show that the 3D F-actin meshwork contracts homogeneously and isotropically throughout the nuclear space. Centrifugation experiments reveal that this homogeneous contraction is translated into asymmetric, directional transport by mechanical anchoring of the meshwork to the cell cortex. Finally, by injecting inert particles of different sizes, we show that this directional transport activity is size-selective and transduced to chromosomal cargo at least in part by steric trapping or "sieving."

abstract = {Neutrophils are cells of the innate immune system that hunt and kill pathogens using directed migration. This process, known as chemotaxis, requires the regulation of actin polymerization downstream of chemoattractant receptors. Reciprocal interactions between actin and intracellular signals are thought to underlie many of the sophisticated signal processing capabilities of the chemotactic cascade including adaptation, amplification and long-range inhibition. However, with existing tools, it has been difficult to discern actin's role in these processes. Most studies investigating the role of the actin cytoskeleton have primarily relied on actin-depolymerizing agents, which not only block new actin polymerization but also destroy the existing cytoskeleton. We recently developed a combination of pharmacological inhibitors that stabilizes the existing actin cytoskeleton by inhibiting actin polymerization, depolymerization and myosin-based rearrangements; we refer to these processes collectively as actin dynamics. Here, we investigated how actin dynamics influence multiple signalling responses (PI3K lipid products, calcium and Pak phosphorylation) following acute agonist addition or during desensitization. We find that stabilized actin polymer extends the period of receptor desensitization following agonist binding and that actin dynamics rapidly reset receptors from this desensitized state. Spatial differences in actin dynamics may underlie front/back differences in agonist sensitivity in neutrophils.},

abstract = {No information is available concerning how the maturation environment controls the metabolism of goat oocytes. The objectives of this experiment were to: (1) Determine the concentrations of glucose, lactate, and pyruvate in caprine follicular fluid; and (2) Investigate the effects of physiological concentrations of glucose and lactate in the in vitro maturation (IVM) medium on the metabolism (glycolysis and pyruvate oxidation), protein content, and developmental competence of caprine oocytes and cumulus–oocyte complexes (COCs). Abattoir-derived COCs were matured for 18–20 hr in a defined, SOF-based medium containing 0.75, 1.5 (follicular fluid = 1.4 mM), or 3.0 mM glucose, and 3.0, 6.0 (follicular fluid = 7.1 mM), or 12.0 mM L-lactate. The protein content of oocytes and COCs was not affected (P {\textgreater} 0.05) by the concentration of glucose and lactate in the maturation medium. Increasing glucose and lactate decreased (P ≤ 0.05) glycolytic activity of oocytes, without affecting (P {\textgreater} 0.05) pyruvate oxidation. In COCs, increasing glucose concentrations tended (P = 0.07) to decrease glycolysis. When metabolic activity was corrected for protein content (pmol/µg protein/3 hr), increasing glucose or lactate concentrations in the medium decreased (P ≤ 0.05) pyruvate oxidation in oocytes, but increased (P ≤ 0.05) pyruvate oxidation in COCs. Embryonic development (cleavage and blastocyst development, hatching, and cell number) was not affected (P {\textgreater} 0.05) by the glucose and lactate concentrations tested. These results indicate that concentrations of glucose and lactate in the medium have cell type-specific effects on metabolism of oocytes and COCs, but do not affect developmental competence within the range of concentrations tested.

abstract = {Acommon focus among molecular and cellular biologists is the identification of proteins that interact with each other. Yeast two-hybrid, cDNA expression library screening, and coimmunoprecipitation experiments are powerful methods for identifying novel proteins that bind to one's favorite protein for the purpose of learning more regarding its cellular function. These same techniques, coupled with truncation and mutagenesis experiments, have been used to define the region of interaction between pairs of proteins. One conclusion from this work is that many interactions occur over short regions, often less than 10 amino acids in length within one protein. For example, mapping studies and 3-dimensional analyses of antigen-antibody interactions have revealed that epitopes are typically 4-7 residues long (1). Other examples include protein-interaction modules, such as Src homology (SH) 2 and 3 domains, phosphotyrosine binding domains (PTB), postsynaptic density/disc-large/ZO1 (PDZ) domains, WW domains, Eps15 homology (EH) domains, and 14-3-3 proteins that typically recognize linear regions of 3-9 amino acids. Each of these domains has been the subject of recent reviews published elsewhere (2 3 4 5 6 7). Among the primary structures of many ligands for protein-protein interactions, the amino acid proline is critical. In particular, SH3, WW, and several new protein-interaction domains prefer ligand sequences that are proline-rich. In addition, even though ligands for EH domains and 14-3-3 domains are not proline-rich, they do include a single proline residue. This review highlights the analysis of those protein-protein interactions that involve proline residues, the biochemistry of proline, and current drug discovery efforts based on proline peptidomimetics.-Kay, B.

@article{Burg2007,
abstract = {Cells in the renal inner medulla are normally exposed to extraordinarily high levels of NaCl and urea. The osmotic stress causes numerous perturbations because of the hypertonic effect of high NaCl and the direct denaturation of cellular macromolecules by high urea. High NaCl and urea elevate reactive oxygen species, cause cytoskeletal rearrangement, inhibit DNA replication and transcription, inhibit translation, depolarize mitochondria, and damage DNA and proteins. Nevertheless, cells can accommodate by changes that include accumulation of organic osmolytes and increased expression of heat shock proteins. Failure to accommodate results in cell death by apoptosis. Although the adapted cells survive and function, many of the original perturbations persist, and even contribute to signaling the adaptive responses. This review addresses both the perturbing effects of high NaCl and urea and the adaptive responses. We speculate on the sensors of osmolality and document the multiple pathways that signal activation of the transcription factor TonEBP/OREBP, which directs many aspects of adaptation. The facts that numerous cellular functions are altered by hyperosmolality and remain so, even after adaptation, indicate that both the effects of hyperosmolality and adaptation to it involve profound alterations of the state of the cells.},

Contractility of the actomyosin cortex is tightly regulated in space and time to orchestrate cell shape changes. Conserved biochemical pathways regulate actomyosin networks in subcellular domains which drive cell shape changes. Actomyosin networks display complex dynamics, such as flows and pulses, which participate in myosin distribution and provide a more realistic description of the spatial distribution and evolution of forces during morphogenesis. Such dynamics are influenced by the mechanical properties of actomyosin networks. Moreover, actomyosin can self-organize and respond to mechanical stimuli through multiple types of biomechanical feedback. In this review we propose a framework encapsulating spatiotemporal regulation of contractility from established pathways with the dynamics and mechanics of actomyosin networks. Through the comparison of cytokinesis, cell migration and epithelial morphogenesis, we delineate emergent properties of contractile activity, including self-organization, adaptability and robustness.},

New work is shedding light on the mechanosensitive properties of SFs, including that these structures can respond to mechanical tension by rapid reinforcement and that there are mechanisms to repair strain-induced damage. Although SFs are superficially similar in organization to the sarcomeres of striated muscle, there are intriguing differences in their organization and behavior, indicating that much still needs to be learned about these structures.},

Core elements of the hierarchy are widely conserved, underlying cell polarity development in diverse eukaryotes. To enumerate more fully the protein–protein interactions that mediate cell polarity development, and to uncover novel mechanisms that coordinate the numerous events involved, we carried out a large-scale two-hybrid experiment. 68 Gal4 DNA binding domain fusions of yeast proteins associated with the actin cytoskeleton, septins, the secretory apparatus, and Rho-type GTPases were used to screen an array of yeast transformants that express ∼90{\%} of the predicted Saccharomyces cerevisiae open reading frames as Gal4 activation domain fusions. 191 protein–protein interactions were detected, of which 128 had not been described previously. 44 interactions implicated 20 previously uncharacterized proteins in cell polarity development. Further insights into possible roles of 13 of these proteins were revealed by their multiple two-hybrid interactions and by subcellular localization. Included in the interaction network were associations of Cdc42 and Rho1 pathways with proteins involved in exocytosis, septin organization, actin assembly, microtubule organization, autophagy, cytokinesis, and cell wall synthesis. Other interactions suggested direct connections between Rho1- and Cdc42-regulated pathways; the secretory apparatus and regulators of polarity establishment; actin assembly and the morphogenesis checkpoint; and the exocytic and endocytic machinery. In total, a network of interactions that provide an integrated response of signaling proteins, the cytoskeleton, and organelles to the spatial cues that direct polarity development was revealed.},

abstract = {Spatial organization of signaling complexes is a defining characteristic of the immunological synapse (IS), but its impact on cell communication is unclear. In T cell-APC pairs, more IL-2 is produced when CD28 clusters are segregated from central supramolecular activation cluster (cSMAC)-localized CD3 and into the IS periphery. However, it is not clear in these cellular experiments whether the increased IL-2 is driven by the pattern itself or by upstream events that precipitate the patterns. In this article, we recapitulate key features of physiological synapses using planar costimulation arrays containing antibodies against CD3 and CD28, surrounded by ICAM-1, created by combining multiple rounds of microcontact printing on a single surface. Na{\"{i}}ve T cells traverse these arrays, stopping at features of anti-CD3 antibodies and forming a stable synapse. We directly demonstrate that presenting anti-CD28 in the cell periphery, surrounding an anti-CD3 feature, enhances IL-2 secretion by na{\"{i}}ve CD4(+) T cells compared with having these signals combined in the center of the IS. This increased cytokine production correlates with NF-kappaB translocation and requires PKB/Akt signaling. The ability to arbitrarily and independently control the locations of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 offered the opportunity to examine patterns not precisely attainable in cell-cell interfaces. With these patterns, we show that the peripheral presentation of CD28 has a larger impact on IL-2 secretion than CD3 colocalization/segregation.},

We found that scission events engulfed comparable amounts of transferrin receptor cargo at CCSs of different sizes and CCS did not always disappear following scission. We measured the recruitment dynamics of 34 types of endocytic protein to scission events: Abp1, ACK1, amphiphysin1, APPL1, Arp3, BIN1, CALM, CIP4, clathrin light chain (Clc), cofilin, coronin1B, cortactin, dynamin1/2, endophilin2, Eps15, Eps8, epsin2, FBP17, FCHo1/2, GAK, Hip1R, lifeAct, mu2 subunit of the AP2 complex, myosin1E, myosin6, NECAP, N-WASP, OCRL1, Rab5, SNX9, synaptojanin2$\beta$1, and syndapin2. For each protein we aligned ∼ 1,000 recruitment profiles to their respective scission events and constructed characteristic "recruitment signatures" that were grouped, as for yeast, to reveal the modular organization of mammalian CME. A detailed analysis revealed the unanticipated recruitment dynamics of SNX9, FBP17, and CIP4 and showed that the same set of proteins was recruited, in the same order, to scission events at CCSs of different sizes and lifetimes. Collectively these data reveal the fine-grained temporal structure of CME and suggest a simplified canonical model of mammalian CME in which the same core mechanism of CME, involving actin, operates at CCSs of diverse sizes and lifetimes.},

abstract = {Sla1 and Rvs167 are yeast proteins required for receptor internalization and organization of the actin cytoskeleton. Here we provide evidence that Sla1 and Rvs167 are orthologues of the mammalian CIN85 and endophilin proteins, respectively, which are required for ligand-stimulated growth factor receptor internalization. Sla1 is similar in domain structure to CIN85 and binds directly to the endophilin-like Rvs167. Akin to CIN85, Sla1 interacts with synaptojanins and a ubiquitin ligase that regulates endocytosis. This ubiquitin ligase, Rsp5, binds directly to both Sla1 and Rvs167. The interaction between Rsp5 and Rvs167 is mediated through Rsp5 WW domains and PXY motifs in the central Gly-Pro-Ala-rich domain of Rvs167. Rvs167 PXY motifs are required for Rsp5-dependent monoubiquitination of Rvs167 on Lys481 in the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain. Mutation of Lys481 → Arg causes cells to grow slowly on medium containing 1 m NaCl, although this phenotype is not due to the defect in ubiquitination caused by the K481R mutation. We propose that Rsp5 interaction with Sla1-Rvs167 promotes Rvs167 ubiquitination and regulates activity of this protein complex. Rvs167 ubiquitination is not required for general function of Rvs167, but may control specific Rvs167 SH3 domain-protein interactions or negatively regulate SH3 domain activity.},

abstract = {Pombe Cdc15 homology (PCH) proteins play an important role in a variety of actin-based processes, including clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). The defining feature of the PCH proteins is an evolutionarily conserved EFC/F-BAR domain for membrane association and tubulation. In the present study, we solved the crystal structures of the EFC domains of human FBP17 and CIP4. The structures revealed a gently curved helical-bundle dimer of approximately 220 A in length, which forms filaments through end-to-end interactions in the crystals. The curved EFC dimer fits a tubular membrane with an approximately 600 A diameter. We subsequently proposed a model in which the curved EFC filament drives tubulation. In fact, striation of tubular membranes was observed by phase-contrast cryo-transmission electron microscopy, and mutations that impaired filament formation also impaired membrane tubulation and cell membrane invagination. Furthermore, FBP17 is recruited to clathrin-coated pits in the late stage of CME, indicating its physiological role.},

abstract = {Dynamins are a conserved family of proteins involved in many membrane fusion and fission events. Previously, the dynamin-related protein Vps1 was shown to localize to endocytic sites, and yeast carrying deletions for genes encoding both the BAR domain protein Rvs167 and Vps1 had a more severe endocytic scission defect than either deletion alone. Vps1 and Rvs167 localize to endocytic sites at the onset of invagination and disassemble concomitant with inward vesicle movement. Rvs167-GFP localization is reduced in cells lacking vps1 suggesting that Vps1 influences Rvs167 association with the endocytic complex. Unlike classical dynamins, Vps1 does not have a proline–arginine domain that could interact with SH3 domain-containing proteins. Thus, while Rvs167 has an SH3 domain, it is not clear how an interaction would be mediated. Here, we demonstrate an interaction between Rvs167 SH3 domain and the single type ISH3-binding motif in Vps1. Mutant Vps1 that cannot bind Rvs167 rescues all membrane fusion/fission functions associated with Vps1 except for endocytic function, demonstrating the specificity and mechanistic importance of the interaction. In vitro, an Rvs161/Rvs167 heterodimer can disassemble Vps1 oligomers. Overall, the data support the idea that Vps1 and the amphiphysins function together to mediate scission during endocytosis in yeast.},

abstract = {Abplp is a yeast cortical actin-binding protein that contains an SH3 domain similar to those found in signal transduction proteins that function at the membrane/cytoskeleton interface. Although no detectable phenotypes are associated with a disruption allele of ABP1, mutations that create a requirement for this protein have now been isolated in the previously identified gene SAC6 and in two new genes, SLA1 and SLA2. The SAC6 gene encodes yeast fimbrin, an actin filament-bundling protein. Null mutations in SLA1 and SLA2 cause temperature-sensitive growth defects. Sla1p contains three SH3 domains and is essential for the proper formation of the cortical actin cytoskeleton. The COOH terminus of Sla2p contains a 200 amino acid region with homology to the COOH terminus of talin, a membrane cytoskeletal protein which is a component of fibroblast focal adhesions. Sla2p is required for cellular morphogenesis and polarization of the cortical cytoskeleton. In addition, synthetic-lethal interactions were observed for double-mutants containing null alleles of SLA2 and SAC6. In total, the mutant phenotypes, sequences, and genetic interactions indicate that we have identified novel proteins that cooperate to control the dynamic cytoskeletal rearrangements that are required for the development of cell polarity in budding yeast.},

Over two decades ago the Genetics Perspectives editors solicited a perspective on my participation in the studies that deciphered the mechanism of mating-type switching and revealed the phenomenon of gene silencing in yeast. Although flattered at the time, I thought that preparation of such an article called for a more seasoned researcher who had benefitted from seeing his contributions stand the test of time. Now realizing that our discovery of the transposition of a mutation from the HM$\alpha$ locus into the MAT (mating type) locus has provided the genetic evidence that established the gene transposition model, and having witnessed our conclusions confirmed by subsequent molecular studies, I decided that perhaps this is a good time to recount the chronology of events as they unfolded for me decades ago.},

Here we describe an additional set of four completely heterologous loxP-flanked marker cassettes carrying the genes URA3 and LEU2 from Kluyveromyces lactis, his5+ from Schizosaccharomyces pombe and the dominant resistance marker bler from the bacterial transposon Tn5, which confers resistance to the antibiotic phleomycin. All five loxP–marker gene–loxP gene disruption cassettes can be generated using the same pair of oligonucleotides and all can be used for gene disruption with high efficiency. For marker rescue we have created three additional Cre expression vectors carrying HIS3, TRP1 or bler as the yeast selection marker. The set of disruption cassettes and Cre expression plasmids described here represents a significant further development of the marker rescue system, which is ideally suited to functional analysis of the yeast genome.},

abstract = {Vrp1p (verprolin, End5p) is the yeast ortholog of human Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP)-interacting protein (WIP). Vrp1p localizes to the cortical actin cytoskeleton, is necessary for its polarization to sites of growth and is also essential for endocytosis. At elevated temperature, Vrp1p becomes essential for growth. A C-terminal Vrp1p fragment (C-Vrp1p) retains the ability to localize to the cortical actin cytoskeleton and function in actin-cytoskeleton polarization, endocytosis and growth. Here, we demonstrate that two submodules in C-Vrp1p are required for actin-cytoskeleton polarization: a novel C-terminal actin-binding submodule (CABS) that contains a novel G-actin-binding domain, which we call a verprolin homology 2 C-terminal (VH2-C) domain; and a second submodule comprising the Las17p-binding domain (LBD) that binds Las17p (yeast WASP). The LBD localizes C-Vrp1p to membranes and the cortical actin cytoskeleton. Intriguingly, the LBD is sufficient to restore endocytosis and growth at elevated temperature to Vrp1p-deficient cells. The CABS also restores these functions, but only if modified by a lipid anchor to provide membrane association. Our findings highlight the role of Las17p binding for Vrp1p membrane association, suggest general membrane association may be more important than specific targeting to the cortical actin cytoskeleton for Vrp1p function in endocytosis and cell growth, and suggest that Vrp1p binding to individual effectors may alter their physiological activity.},

Calmodulin performs essential roles in mitosis, through its regulation of Nuf1p/Spc110p, a component of the spindle pole body, and in bud growth, by binding Myo2p, an unconventional class V myosin required for polarized secretion. Surprisingly, mutant calmodulins that fail to bind Ca2+ can perform these essential functions. Calmodulin is also required for endocytosis in yeast and participates in Ca2+-dependent, stress-activated signaling pathways through its regulation of a protein phosphatase, calcineurin, and the protein kinases, Cmk1p and Cmk2p. Thus, calmodulin performs important physiological functions in yeast cells in both its Ca2+-bound and Ca2+-free form.},

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, molecular biological techniques have been developed that use a simple PCR-based strategy to introduce epitope tags to chromosomal loci (Wach et al., 1994). To further employ the power of this strategy, a variety of novel tags was constructed. These tags were combined with different selectable marker genes, resulting in PCR amplificable modules. Only one set of primers is required for the amplification of any module. Furthermore, convenient laboratory techniques are described that facilitate the genetic manipulations of yeast strains, as well as the analysis of the epitope-tagged proteins.

abstract = {Because of its accessibility to genetic and molecular studies, Sacch. cerevisiae is an attractive organism in which to pursue studies of the complex roles of phosphoinositides and other inositol-containing metabolites. Biochemical studies have clearly demonstrated that PI, PIP, PIP2 and the inositol phosphates derived from them exist in Sacch. cerevisiae. It is clear that they are synthesized and turned over following pathways similar to those described in higher eukaryotes. Recent studies on yeast have also suggested that inositol phospholipids may play roles in complex signalling pathways similar to those detected in animal cells. In addition, inositol has been demonstrated to function in yeast as a global regulator of phospholipid synthesis. This regulation occurs on a transcriptional level and is highly complex. It is not yet known whether similar inositol-mediated regulation of phospholipid synthesis occurs in other eukaryotes.},

abstract = {Disruption-deletion cassettes are powerful tools used to study gene function in many organisms, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Perhaps the most widely useful of these are the heterologous dominant drug resistance cassettes, which use antibiotic resistance genes from bacteria and fungi as selectable markers. We have created three new dominant drug resistance cassettes by replacing the kanamycin resistance (kanr) open reading frame from the kanMX3 and kanMX4 disruption-deletion cassettes (Wach et al., 1994) with open reading frames conferring resistance to the antibiotics hygromycin B (hph), nourseothricin (nat) and bialaphos (pat). The new cassettes, pAG25 (natMX4), pAG29 (patMX4), pAG31 (patMX3), pAG32 (hphMX4), pAG34 (hphMX3) and pAG35 (natMX3), are cloned into pFA6, and so are in all other respects identical to pFA6–kanMX3 and pFA6–kanMX4. Most tools and techniques used with the kanMX plasmids can also be used with the hph, nat and patMX containing plasmids. These new heterologous dominant drug resistance cassettes have unique antibiotic resistance phenotypes and do not affect growth when inserted into the ho locus. These attributes make the cassettes ideally suited for creating S. cerevisiae strains with multiple mutations within a single strain. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1999 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {The rate of actomyosin ring constriction in cells of different sizes correlates with myosin motor concentration in Neurospora crassa cells, leading to increased division rates in larger cells during cytokinesis., In eukaryotes, cytokinesis is accomplished by an actomyosin-based contractile ring. Although in Caenorhabditis elegans embryos larger cells divide at a faster rate than smaller cells, it remains unknown whether a similar mode of scalability operates in other cells. We investigated cytokinesis in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa, which exhibits a wide range of hyphal circumferences. We found that N. crassa cells divide using an actomyosin ring and larger rings constricted faster than smaller rings. However, unlike in C. elegans, the total amount of myosin remained constant throughout constriction, and there was a size-dependent increase in the starting concentration of myosin in the ring. We predict that the increased number of ring-associated myosin motors in larger rings leads to the increased constriction rate. Accordingly, reduction or inhibition of ring-associated myosin slows down the rate of constriction. Because the mechanical characteristics of contractile rings are conserved, we predict that these findings will be relevant to actomyosin ring constriction in other cell types.},

abstract = {Sla1 and Rvs167 are yeast proteins required for receptor internalization and organization of the actin cytoskeleton. Here we provide evidence that Sla1 and Rvs167 are orthologues of the mammalian CIN85 and endophilin proteins, respectively, which are required for ligand-stimulated growth factor receptor internalization. Sla1 is similar in domain structure to CIN85 and binds directly to the endophilin-like Rvs167. Akin to CIN85, Sla1 interacts with synaptojanins and a ubiquitin ligase that regulates endocytosis. This ubiquitin ligase, Rsp5, binds directly to both Sla1 and Rvs167. The interaction between Rsp5 and Rvs167 is mediated through Rsp5 WW domains and PXY motifs in the central Gly-Pro-Ala-rich domain of Rvs167. Rvs167 PXY motifs are required for Rsp5-dependent monoubiquitination of Rvs167 on Lys481 in the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain. Mutation of Lys481 → Arg causes cells to grow slowly on medium containing 1 m NaCl, although this phenotype is not due to the defect in ubiquitination caused by the K481R mutation. We propose that Rsp5 interaction with Sla1-Rvs167 promotes Rvs167 ubiquitination and regulates activity of this protein complex. Rvs167 ubiquitination is not required for general function of Rvs167, but may control specific Rvs167 SH3 domain-protein interactions or negatively regulate SH3 domain activity.},

In addition, all three yeast gene products shared with synaptojanin regions of homology to the SAC1 gene of yeast. Disruption of each of these genes singly and in pairs produced mutant strains that were viable but demonstrated variable phenotypes of abnormal vacuolar and plasma membrane morphology as well as increased sensitivity to osmotic stress. Total phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate 5-phosphatase activity was reduced to varying degrees in each of the strains. No defect in carboxypeptidase Y sorting was seen in a processing and targeting assay. Abnormal actin cytoskeleton morphology was present in some of the strains carrying mutations in two of the genes.},

abstract = {Summary 
Actin filaments and myosin II are evolutionarily conserved force-generating components of the contractile ring during cytokinesis. Here we show that in budding yeast, actin filament depolymerization plays a major role in actomyosin ring constriction. Cofilin mutation or chemically stabilizing actin filaments attenuate actomyosin ring constriction. Deletion of myosin II motor domain or the myosin regulatory light chain reduced the contraction rate and also the rate of actin depolymerization in the ring. We constructed a quantitative microscopic model of actomyosin ring constriction via filament sliding driven by both actin depolymerization and myosin II motor activity. Model simulations based on experimental measurements support the notion that actin depolymerization is the predominant mechanism for ring constriction. The model predicts invariability of total contraction time regardless of the initial ring size, as originally reported for C. elegans embryonic cells. This prediction was validated in yeast cells of different sizes due to different ploidies.},

Although phosphorylation of its regulatory light chain (MRLC) is known to be involved in myosin II filament assembly and motor activity in vitro, it remains unclear exactly how MRLC phosphorylation regulates myosin II dynamics in vivo. We established clones of Madin Darby canine kidney II epithelial cells expressing MRLC-enhanced green fluorescent protein or its mutants. Time-lapse imaging revealed that both phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are required for proper dynamics of myosin II. Inhibitors affecting myosin phosphorylation and MRLC mutants indicated that monophosphorylation of MRLC is required and sufficient for maintenance of stress fibers. Diphosphorylated MRLC stabilized myosin II filaments and was distributed locally in regions of stress fibers where contraction occurs, suggesting that diphosphorylation is involved in the spatial regulation of myosin II assembly and contraction. We further found that myosin phosphatase or Zipper-interacting protein kinase localizes to stress fibers depending on the activity of myosin II ATPase.},

When grown in sparse culture with no cell-cell contacts, fibroblasts and endothelial cells show an abrupt change in spread area that occurs at a stiffness range around 3,000 Pa. No actin stress fibers are seen in fibroblasts on soft surfaces, and the appearance of stress fibers is abrupt and complete at a stiffness range coincident with that at which they spread. Upregulation of alpha5 integrin also occurs in the same stiffness range, but exogenous expression of alpha5 integrin is not sufficient to cause cell spreading on soft surfaces. Neutrophils, in contrast, show no dependence of either resting shape or ability to spread after activation when cultured on surfaces as soft as 2 Pa compared to glass. The shape and cytoskeletal differences evident in single cells on soft compared to hard substrates are eliminated when fibroblasts or endothelial cells make cell-cell contact. These results support the hypothesis that mechanical factors impact different cell types in fundamentally different ways, and can trigger specific changes similar to those stimulated by soluble ligands.},

Vrp1p residues, (788)MPKPR(792) are essential for Vrp1p-Las17p interaction. While C-Vrp1p(364-817) complements all the defects of the vrp1$\Delta$ strain, C-Vrp1p(364-817)(5A) ((788)AAAAA(792)) does not complement any of the defects, due to its inability to localize to cortical patches. Targeting C-Vrp1p(364-817)(5A) to membranes using CAAX motif (C-Vrp1p(364-817)(5A)-CAAX) rescued the growth and endocytosis defect but not the actin patch polarization defect of vrp1$\Delta$. Vrp1p can localize to cortical patches, either by binding to Las17p through LBD (Las17 Binding Domain, Vrp1p(760-817)) or independent of Las17p through residues in N-Vrp1p(1-364). Unlike Vrp1p, Vrp1p(5A) localizes poorly to cortical patches and complements all the defects of vrp1$\Delta$ strain except actin patch polarization at elevated temperature. N-Vrp1p(1-364) complements all the defects of vrp1$\Delta$ strain except the actin patch polarization defect while N-Vrp1p(1-364)-LBD fusion protein complements all the defects. Thus our results show that while both Vrp1p and Las17p are essential for many cellular processes, the two proteins do not necessarily have to bind to each other to carry out these cellular functions. However, Las17p-Vrp1p interaction is essential for actin patch polarization at elevated temperature.},

We have studied the way in which circular and linear molecules recombine with homologous chromosomal sequences. We show that DNA ends are highly recombinogenic and interact directly with homologous sequences. Circular hybrid plasmids can integrate by a single reciprocal crossover, but only at a low frequency. Restriction enzyme digestion within a region homologous to yeast chromosomal DNA greatly enhances the efficiency of integration. Furthermore, if two restriction cuts are made within the same homologous sequence, thereby removing an internal segment of DNA, the resulting deleted-linear molecules are still able to transform at a high frequency. Surprisingly, the integration of these gapped-linear molecules results in replacement of the missing segment using chromosomal information. The final structure is identical to that obtained from integration of a circular molecule. The integration of linear and gapped-linear molecules, but not of circular molecules, is blocked by the rad52-1 mutation. Consideration of models for plasmid integration and gene conversion suggests that RAD52 may be involved in the DNA repair synthesis required for these processes. Implications of this work for the isolation of integrative transformants, fine-structure mapping, and the cloning of mutations are discussed.},

abstract = {There are two vertebrate nonmuscle myosin heavy chain (MHC) genes that encode two separate isoforms of the heavy chain, MHC-A and MHC-B. Recent work has identified additional, alternatively spliced isoforms of MHC-B cDNA with inserted sequences of 30 nucleotides (chicken and human) or 48 nucleotides (Xenopus) at a site corresponding to the ATP binding region in the MHC protein (Takahashi, M., Kawamoto, S., and Adelstein, R. S.(1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 17864-17871) and Bhatia-Dey, N., Adelstein, R. S., and Dawid, I. B. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 90, 2856-2859). The deduced amino acid sequence of these inserts contains a consensus sequence for phosphorylation by cyclin-p34 (cdc2) kinase. In cultured Xenopus XTC cells, we have identified two inserted MHC-B isoforms and a noninserted MHC-A isoform by immunoblotting of cell extracts. When myosin was immunoprecipitated from XTC cells and phosphorylated in vitro with cdc2 kinase, the kinase catalyzed the phosphorylation of both inserted MHC-B isoforms but not MHC-A. Isoelectric focusing of tryptic peptides generated from MHC-B phosphorylated with cdc2 kinase revealed one major phosphopeptide that was purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography and sequenced. The phosphorylated residue was Ser-214, the cdc2 kinase consensus site within the insert near the ATP binding region. The same site was phosphorylated in intact XTC cells during log phase of growth and in cell-free lysates of Xenopus eggs stabilized in second meiotic metaphase but not interphase. Moreover, Ser-214 phosphorylation was detected during maturation of Xenopus oocytes when the cdc2 kinase-containing maturation-promoting factor was activated, but not in G2 interphase-arrested oocytes. These results demonstrate that MHC-B phosphorylation is tightly regulated by cdc2 kinase during meiotic cell cycles. Furthermore, MHC-A and MHC-B isoforms are differentially phosphorylated at these stages, suggesting that they may serve different functions in these cells.},

There has been a great deal of interest in the mechanism of lamellipodial protrusion (Pollard, T., and G. Borisy. 2003. Cell. 112:453–465). However, one of this mechanism's endpoints, the force of protrusion, has never been directly measured. We place an atomic force microscopy cantilever in the path of a migrating keratocyte. The deflection of the cantilever, which occurs over a period of ∼10 s, provides a direct measure of the force exerted by the lamellipodial leading edge. Stall forces are consistent with ∼100 polymerizing actin filaments per micrometer of the leading edge, each working as an elastic Brownian ratchet and generating a force of several piconewtons. However, the force-velocity curves obtained from this measurement, in which velocity drops sharply under very small loads, is not sensitive to low loading forces, and finally stalls rapidly at large loads, are not consistent with current theoretical models for the actin polymerization force. Rather, the curves indicate that the protrusive force generation is a complex multiphase process involving actin and adhesion dynamics.},

The barrier-forming characteristics of aluminum oxide, indium?tin oxide (ITO), chrome, and gold patterns on silica substrates have been examined. All four materials form effective barriers to lateral diffusion within the supported membrane; however, two distinctly different mechanisms were observed. Aluminum oxide inhibits vesicle fusion, thus restricting membrane formation to the exposed silica surface. In contrast, vesicles will fuse with ITO, chrome, and, to some extent, gold; however, the resulting membrane is effectively immobile over the time scale of several hours. These materials partition the supported membrane by selectively immobilizing membrane that adsorbs to their surface. The two mechanisms of membrane partitioning described here provide additional flexibility in the design and application of micropatterned membranes.},

abstract = {The actin cytoskeleton is a fundamental component of eukaryotic cells, with both structural and motile roles. Actin and many of the actin-binding proteins found in different cell types are highly conserved, showing considerable similarity in both primary structure and biochemical properties. To make detailed comparisons between homologous proteins, it is necessary to know whether the various proteins are functionally, as well as structurally, conserved. Fimbrin is an example of a cytoskeletal component that, as shown by sequence determinations and biochemical characterizations, is conserved between organisms as diverse as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and humans. In this study, we examined whether the human homolog can substitute for the yeast protein in vivo. We report here that two isoforms of human fimbrin, also referred to as T- and L-plastin, can both substitute in vivo for yeast fimbrin, also known as Sac6p, whereas a third isoform, I-fimbrin (or I-plastin), cannot. We demonstrate that the human T- and L-fimbrins, in addition to complementing the temperature-sensitive growth defect of the sac6 null mutant, restore both normal cytoskeletal organization and cell shape to the mutant cells. In addition, we show that human T- and L-fimbrins can complement a sporulation defect caused by the sac6 null mutation. These findings indicate that there is a high degree of functional conservation in the cytoskeleton, even between organisms as diverse as S. cerevisiae and humans.},

abstract = {The Arp2/3 complex is essential for actin assembly and motility in many cell processes, and a large number of proteins have been found to bind and regulate it in vitro. A critical challenge is to understand the actions of these proteins in cells, especially in settings where multiple regulators are present. In a systematic study of the sequential multicomponent actin assembly processes that accompany endocytosis in yeast, we examined and compared the roles of WASp, two type-I myosins, and two other Arp2/3 activators, along with that of coronin, which is a proposed inhibitor of Arp2/3. Quantitative analysis of high-speed fluorescence imaging revealed individual functions for the regulators, manifested in part by novel phenotypes. We conclude that Arp2/3 regulators have distinct and overlapping roles in the processes of actin assembly that drive endocytosis in yeast. The formation of the endocytic actin patch, the creation of the endocytic vesicle, and the movement of the vesicle into the cytoplasm display distinct dependencies on different Arp2/3 regulators. Knowledge of these roles provides insight into the in vivo relevance of the dendritic nucleation model for actin assembly.},

In one approach, we constructed a protein array of about 6,000 yeast transformants, with each transformant expressing one of the open reading frames as a fusion to an activation domain. This array was screened by a simple and automated procedure for 192 yeast proteins, with positive responses identified by their positions in the array. In a second approach, we pooled cells expressing one of about 6,000 activation domain fusions to generate a library. We used a high-throughput screening procedure to screen nearly all of the 6,000 predicted yeast proteins, expressed as Gal4 DNA-binding domain fusion proteins, against the library, and characterized positives by sequence analysis. These approaches resulted in the detection of 957 putative interactions involving 1,004 S. cerevisiae proteins. These data reveal interactions that place functionally unclassified proteins in a biological context, interactions between proteins involved in the same biological function, and interactions that link biological functions together into larger cellular processes. The results of these screens are shown here.},

abstract = {Phosphoinositides (PI) are synthesized and turned over by specific kinases, phosphatases, and lipases that ensure the proper localization of discrete PI isoforms at distinct membranes. We analyzed the role of the yeast synaptojanin-like proteins using a strain that expressed only a temperature-conditional allele of SJL2. Our analysis demonstrated that inactivation of the yeast synaptojanins leads to increased cellular levels of phosphatidylinositol (3,5)-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P(2)), accompanied by defects in actin organization, endocytosis, and clathrin-mediated sorting between the Golgi and endosomes. The phenotypes observed in synaptojanin-deficient cells correlated with accumulation of PtdIns(4,5)P(2), because these effects were rescued by mutations in MSS4 or a mutant form of Sjl2p that harbors only PI 5-phosphatase activity. We utilized green fluorescent protein-pleckstrin homology domain chimeras (termed FLAREs for fluorescent lipid-associated reporters) with distinct PI-binding specificities to visualize pools of PtdIns(4,5)P(2) and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate in yeast. PtdIns(4,5)P(2) localized to the plasma membrane in a manner dependent on Mss4p activity. On inactivation of the yeast synaptojanins, PtdIns(4,5)P(2) accumulated in intracellular compartments, as well as the cell surface. In contrast, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate generated by Pik1p localized in intracellular compartments. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the yeast synaptojanins control the localization of PtdIns(4,5)P(2) in vivo and provide further evidence for the compartmentalization of different PI species.},

Understanding the underlying mechanism of actin network assembly is of fundamental importance. We developed in this work a minimal motility model and performed stochastic simulations to study mechanical regulation of the growth dynamics of lamellipodia-like branched actin networks, characterized by various force-velocity relations. In such networks, the treadmilling process leads to a concentration gradient of G-actin, thus G-actin transport is essential to effective actin network assembly. We first explore how capping protein modulates force-velocity relations and then discuss how actin transport due to diffusion and facilitated transport such as advective flow tunes the growth dynamics of the branched actin network. Our work demonstrates the important role of molecular transport in determining the adaptive response of the actin network to an external force.},

Nevertheless, myosin IIA-deficient cells display substantially increased cell migration and exaggerated membrane ruffling, which was dependent on the small G-protein Rac1, its activator Tiam1 and the microtubule moter kinesin Eg5. Myosin IIA deficiency stabilized microtubules, shifting the balance between actomyosin and microtubules with increased microtubules in active membrane ruffles. When microtubule polymerization was suppressed, myosin IIB could partially compensate for the absence of the IIA isoform in cellular contractility, but not in cell migration.

We also show that retrograde flow of actin cables mediates retrograde actin patch movement. An Arp2/3 complex mutation decreases the frequency of cortical, nonlinear actin patch movements, but has no effect on the velocity of linear, retrograde actin patch movement. Rather, linear actin patch movement occurs at the same velocity and direction as the movement of actin cables. Moreover, actin patches require actin cables for retrograde movements and colocalize with actin cables as they undergo retrograde movement. Our studies support a mechanism whereby actin cables serve as “conveyor belts” for retrograde movement and delivery of actin patches/endosomes to FM4-64–labeled internal compartments.},

abstract = {The spatial organization of cell–cell adherens junctions is distinct in cultured cells from two different tissue types, specifically, epitheliocytes and fibroblasts. In epitheliocytes, contacts are localized tangentially, along contacting cell edges and in association with circumferential actin bundles. Contacts between fibroblasts are radially oriented; that is, they are perpendicular to the overlapping edges of the cells and are associated with straight bundles of actin filaments. In the present study, we establish that the spatial organization of cell–cell contacts in the epithelial cell line IAR-2 can be converted from the typical tangential pattern to the radial pattern observed in fibroblasts. This transition can be induced by treatment with two agents, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and nocodazole, which have different modes of action. Inhibition of myosin contractility reverses tangential-to-radial conversion of cell–cell contacts. These data suggest that formation of radially aligned contacts depends on modulation of contractility within the actin cytoskeleton through the myosin motor protein. The results open the possibility that modulation of the spatial organization of cell–cell contacts may play important roles in regulating organization and physiological functions of epithelial tissues.},

abstract = {Nonmuscle myosin IIA and IIB distribute preferentially toward opposite ends of migrating endothelial cells. To understand the mechanism and function of this behavior, myosin II was examined in cells treated with the motor inhibitor, blebbistatin. Blebbistatin at ≥30 $\mu$M inhibited anterior redistribution of myosin IIA, with 100 $\mu$M blebbistatin causing posterior accumulation. Posterior accumulation of myosin IIB was unaffected. Time-lapse cinemicrography showed myosin IIA entering lamellipodia shortly after their formation, but failing to move into lamellipodia in blebbistatin. Thus, myosin II requires motor activity to move forward onto F-actin in protrusions. However, this movement is inhibited by myosin filament assembly, because whole myosin was delayed relative to a tailless fragment. Inhibiting myosin's forward movement reduced coupling between protrusive activity and translocation of the cell body: In untreated cells, body movement followed advancing lamellipodia, whereas blebbistatin-treated cells extended protrusions without displacement of the body or with a longer delay before movement. Anterior cytoplasm of blebbistatin-treated cells contained disorganized bundles of parallel microfilaments, but anterior F-actin bundles in untreated cells were mostly oriented perpendicular to movement. Myosin II may ordinarily move anteriorly on actin filaments and pull crossed filaments into antiparallel bundles, with the resulting realignment pulling the cell body forward.},

abstract = {Mutations in RVS161 andRVS167, the two yeast amphiphysin homologs, cause very similar growth phenotypes, a depolarized actin cytoskeleton, and a defect in the internalization step of endocytosis. Rvs161p and Rvs167p have been shown to interact in the two-hybrid system, but their localization in the cell may be different thus raising the question whether the interaction is physiologically relevant. Here we demonstrate that the two proteins function together in vivo. We find that the steady state level of Rvs167p is strongly reduced in an rvs161$\Delta$ strain. Similarly, the level of Rvs161p is strongly reduced in an rvs167$\Delta$ strain. We demonstrate that these reduced protein levels at steady state are due to a decreased stability of either Rvs protein in the absence of the other protein. Furthermore, we find that the amount and ratio of Rvs161p and Rvs167p are critical parameters for receptor-mediated endocytosis. In addition, by using the two-hybrid system we show that the interaction of Rvs167p with actin is not abolished in anabp1$\Delta$ strain suggesting that Abp1p is not essential for this interaction.},

abstract = {Until recently, the actin cytoskeleton and the endocytic machinery were thought to operate independently. However, the actin cytoskeleton is an integral part of the cell cortex and there is growing evidence in diverse eukaryotes that F-actin plays a direct role during endocytic internalization. Genetic studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae have demonstrated that Arp2/3-mediated F-actin assembly is required specifically for the internalization step of endocytosis. Using real-time image analysis, we recently defined a pathway for receptor-mediated endocytosis in budding yeast. Many features of this pathway appear to be conserved widely, indicating that principles derived from our studies in yeast will be directly applicable in more complex eukaryotes. We are pursuing our yeast studies using a combined approach involving image analysis, functional genomics, proteomics and biochemistry. These ongoing studies are providing a broader and deeper understanding of the molecular events of endocytosis, of how forces for actin polymerization are harnessed, and of how steps in the pathway are regulated. Our studies in mammalian cells provide evidence that this pathway is conserved in more complex organisms for endocytic and Golgi trafficking events.},

abstract = {Amphiphysins, members of the BAR (Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvsp) protein super family, have been postulated to play a key role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis of synaptic vesicles (SVs). This review focuses on recent genetic studies of the role of amphiphysins in SV recycling and membrane morphogenesis. In the mouse, brain-specific amphiphysin I and II regulate, but are not essential for, SV recycling. The role of this regulation appears important, as mice deficient in these proteins have seizures and are deficient in learning and memory. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, amphiphysin is found in muscles and is enriched at postsynaptic membranes of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs); however, it does not play a role in SV recycling. Rather, amphiphysin in fly muscles appears to regulate the organization and structure of the muscle T-tubule system and possibly the subsynaptic reticulum. Amphiphysin is also involved in membrane organization in both neurons and non-neuronal cells in Drosophila. These studies reveal pleiotropic functions for amphiphysins in clathrin-mediated endocytosis and the regulation of membrane dynamics, perhaps through the actin cytoskeleton.},

This set of adaptors, which includes the mammalian proteins amphiphysin and Bin1 and the yeast proteins Rvs167p and Rvs161p, has been implicated in diverse cellular processes, including synaptic vesicle endocytosis, actin regulation, differentiation, cell survival, and tumorigenesis. Here we report the identification and characterization of Bin2, a novel protein that contains a BAR domain but that is otherwise structurally dissimilar to other members of the BAR adaptor family. The Bin2 gene is located at chromosome 4q22.1 and is expressed predominantly in hematopoietic cells. Bin2 is upregulated during differentiation of granulocytes, suggesting that it functions in that lineage. Bin2 formed a stable complex in cells with Bin1, but not with amphiphysin, in a BAR domain-dependent manner. This finding indicates that BAR domains have specific preferences for interaction. However, Bin2 did not influence endocytosis in the same manner as brain-specific splice isoforms of Bin1, nor did it exhibit the tumor suppressor properties inherent to ubiquitous splice isoforms of Bin1. Thus, Bin2 appears to encode a nonredundant function in the BAR adaptor gene family.},

abstract = {At the leading edge of a motile cell, actin polymerizes in close apposition to the plasma membrane. Here we ask how the machinery for force generation at a leading edge is established de novo after the global depolymerization of actin. The depolymerization is accomplished by latrunculin A, and the reorganization of actin upon removal of the drug is visualized in Dictyostelium cells by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. The actin filament system is reorganized in three steps. First, F-actin assembles into globular complexes that move along the bottom surface of the cells at velocities up to 10 $\mu$m/min. These clusters are transient structures that eventually disassemble, fuse, or divide. In a second step, clusters merge into a contiguous zone at the cell border that spreads and gives rise to actin waves traveling on a planar membrane. Finally, normal cell shape and motility are resumed. These data show that the initiation of actin polymerization is separated in Dictyostelium from front protrusion, and that the coupling of polymerization to protrusion is a later step in the reconstitution of a leading edge.},

abstract = {In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the WASP (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein) homologue Las17p (also called Bee1p) is an important component of cortical actin patches. Las17p is part of a high-molecular-weight protein complex that regulates Arp2/3 complex-dependent actin polymerization at the cell cortex and that includes the type I myosins Myo3p and Myo5p and verprolin (Vrp1p). To identify other factors implicated with this complex in actin regulation, we isolated proteins that bind to Las17p by two-hybrid screening and affinity chromatography. Here, we report the characterization of Lsb7/Bzz1p (for Las seventeen binding protein 7), an Src homology 3 (SH3) domain protein that interacts directly with Las17p via a polyproline-SH3 interaction. Bzz1p coimmunoprecipitates in a complex with Las17p, Vrp1p, Myo3/5p, Bbc1p, Hsp70p, and actin. It colocalizes with cortical actin patches and with Las17p. This localization is dependent on Las17p, but not on F-actin. Bzz1p interacts physically and genetically with type I myosins. While deletion of BZZ1 shows no obvious phenotype, simultaneous deletion of the BZZ1, MYO3, and MYO5 genes is lethal. Overexpression of Bzz1p inhibits cell growth, and a bzz1$\Delta$ myo5$\Delta$ double mutant is unable to restore actin polarity after NaCl stress. Finally, Bzz1p in vitro is able to recruit a functional actin polymerization machinery through its SH3 domains. Its interactions with Las17p, Vrp1p, and the type I myosins are essential for this process. This suggests that Bzz1p could be implicated in the regulation of actin polymerization.},

abstract = {Summary
BAR proteins are involved in a variety of membrane remodeling events but how they can mold membranes into different shapes remains poorly understood. Using electron paramagnetic resonance, we find that vesicle binding of the N-BAR protein amphiphysin is predominantly mediated by the shallow insertion of amphipathic N-terminal helices. In contrast, the interaction with tubes involves deeply inserted N-terminal helices together with the concave surface of the BAR domain, which acts as a scaffold. Combined with the observed concentration dependence of tubulation and BAR domain scaffolding, the data indicate that initial membrane deformations and vesicle binding are mediated by insertion of amphipathic helical wedges, while tubulation requires high protein densities at which oligomeric BAR domain scaffolds form. In addition, we identify a pocket of residues on the concave surface of the BAR domain that insert deeply into tube membrane. Interestingly, this pocket harbors a number of disease mutants in the homologous amphiphysin 2.},

abstract = {The yeast amphiphysin homologue Rvs167p plays a role in regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, endocytosis, and sporulation. Rvs167p is a phosphoprotein in vegetatively growing cells and shows increased phosphorylation upon treatment with mating pheromone. Previous work has shown that Rvs167p can be phosphorylated in vitro by the cyclin-dependent kinase Pho85p complexed with its cyclin Pcl2p. Using chymotryptic phosphopeptide mapping, we have identified the sites on which Rvs167p is phosphorylated in vitro by Pcl2p-Pho85p. We have shown that these same sites are phosphorylated in vivo during vegetative growth and that phosphorylation at two of these sites is Pcl-Pho85p dependent. In cells treated with mating pheromone, the MAP kinase Fus3p is needed for full phosphorylation of Rvs167p. Functional genomics and genetics experiments revealed that mutation of other actin cytoskeleton genes compromises growth of a strain in which phosphorylation of Rvs167p is blocked by mutation. Phosphorylation of Rvs167p inhibits its interaction in vitro with Las17p, an activator of the Arp2/3 complex, as well as with a novel protein, Ymr192p. Our results suggest that phosphorylation of Rvs167p by a cyclin-dependent kinase and by a MAP kinase is an important mechanism for regulating protein complexes involved in actin cytoskeleton function.},

Many open questions remain about the mechanisms by which membrane-bending proteins function. Addressing this shortfall, recent structures of BAR protein:membrane complexes support existing mechanistic models, but also produced novel insights into how BAR domain proteins sense, stabilize, and generate curvature.

abstract = {Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells lacking the amphiphysin-like orthologs, Rvs161 or Rvs167, are unable to thrive under many stress conditions. Here we show cells lacking Rvs161 require Cdc55, the B subunit of the yeast ceramide-activated protein phosphatase, for viability under heat stress. By using specific rvs mutant alleles, we linked this lethal genetic interaction to loss of Rvs161 endocytic domain function. Recessive mutations in the sphingolipid pathway, such as deletion of the very long-chain fatty acid elongase, Sur4, suppress the osmotic growth defect of rvs161 cells. We demonstrate that Cdc55 is required for sur4-dependent suppressor activity and that protein phosphatase activation, through overexpression of CDC55 alone, can also remediate this defect. Loss of SUR4 in rvs161 cells reinitiates Ste3 a-factor receptor endocytosis and requires Cdc55 function to do so. Moreover, overexpression of CDC55 reinitiates Ste3 endocytic-dependent degradation and restores fluid phase endocytosis in rvs161 cells. In contrast, loss of SUR4 or CDC55 overexpression does not remediate the actin polarization defects of osmotic stressed rvs161 cells. Importantly, remediation of rvs161 defects by protein phosphatase activation requires the ceramide-activated protein phosphatase catalytic subunit, Sit4, and the protein phosphatase 2A catalytic subunits, Pph21/Pph22. Finally, genetic analyses reveal a synthetic lethal interaction between loss of CDC55 and gene deletions lethal with rvs161, all of which function in endocytosis.},

abstract = {Simplified in vitro systems are ideally suited for studying the principle mechanisms of the contraction of cytoskeletal actin systems. To shed light on the dependence of the contraction mechanism on the nature of the crosslinking proteins, we study reconstituted in vitro active actin networks on different length scales ranging from the molecular organization to the macroscopic contraction. Distinct contraction mechanisms are observed in polar and apolar crosslinked active gels whereas composite active gels crosslinked in a polar and apolar fashion at the same time exhibit both mechanisms simultaneously. In polar active actin/fascin networks initially bundles are formed which are then rearranged. In contrast, apolar cortexillin-I crosslinked active gels are bundled only after reorganization of actin filaments by myosin-II motor filaments.},

abstract = {Regulation of actin polymerization is essential for cell functioning. Here, we predict a novel phenomenon—the force-driven polymerization of actin filaments mediated by proteins of the formin family. Formins localize to the barbed ends of actin filaments, but, in contrast to the standard capping proteins, allow for actin polymerization in the barbed direction. First, we show that the mechanism of such “leaky capping” can be understood in terms of the elasticity of the formin molecules. Second, we demonstrate that if a pulling force acts on the filament end via the leaky cap, the elastic stresses can drive actin polymerization. We estimate that a moderate pulling force of ∼3.4 pN is sufficient to reduce the critical actin concentration required for barbed end polymerization by an order of magnitude. Furthermore, the pulling force increases the polymerization rate. The suggested mechanism of force-driven polymerization could be a key element in a variety of cellular mechanosensing devices.},

abstract = {The membrane bending and GTPase-binding functions of proteins from the BAR-domain family, BAR-domains recently took centre stage in science through a report on the crystal structure of this domain in Drosophila Amphiphysin. Though only weakly conserved at the sequence level, the structure of the BAR domain shows striking similarity to the GTPase-binding domain of Arfaptin 2, an effector of Rho- and Arf- GTPases. On the basis of this sequence and structural similarity, these two proteins have been classified as belonging to the same family, the BAR-domain family, and they probably also have similar functional characteristics. Presented here are the results of a database search for the sequence of the BAR domain of Amphiphysin and Arfaptin 2. This search identified a variety of related proteins, most of which are involved in intracellular transport and especially in endocytosis. For example, the BAR-domain family includes Endophilins, GTPase-activating proteins of the Centaurin$\beta$ family and Oligophrenins, the adaptor proteins APPL1 and APPL2 that were recently shown to interact with the small GTPase Rab5, as well as members of the Sorting nexin family. On the basis of the structures of Amphiphysin and Arfaptin 2 and the cellular role of Amphiphysins in the early steps of endocytosis, the functions of the BAR domain have been defined as a dimerization motif and as sensing and inducing membrane curvature. However, data on Arfaptin 2 and now also on the Adaptor proteins APPL1 and 2 suggest that another function of the BAR domain is to bind to small GTPases.},

abstract = {Traction force generated at focal adhesions (FAs) of cells plays an essential role in regulating cellular functions. However, little is known about how the traction force at each FA changes during cell stretching. Here we investigated dynamic changes in traction force at FAs during macroscopic stretching of porcine aortic smooth muscle cells (SMCs) cultured on elastic micropillar substrates. SMCs were cultured on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based substrates with a micropillar array, and stretched approximately in the direction of their major axis and then released by stretching and relaxing the substrates. This stretch-release cycle was repeated twice with cell strain rates of 0.3{\%}/15s up to a 3{\%} strain, and the deflection of the PDMS micropillars was measured simultaneously to obtain the traction force at each FA F, total force in the cell's major axis direction F(all), and whole-cell strain $\epsilon$(cell). Traction forces of SMCs during stretching varied widely with location: their changes at some pillars synchronized well with the applied strain $\epsilon$(cell), but others did not synchronized. Whole-cell stiffness estimated as the slope of the loading limb of the F(all)-$\epsilon$(cell) curves was ∼10nN/{\%}, which was the same order of magnitude of the reported stiffness of cultured SMCs obtained in a tensile test. Interestingly, F(all) at a zero-strain state (pretension at the whole-cell level) actively increased in some cells following the loading/unloading process, as did whole-cell stiffness. Such a change did not occur in cultured SMCs in the tensile test in which cells were held with a pair of micropipettes coated with nonspecific adhesive. These results indicate that SMCs showed a myogenic response when stretched through their multiple FAs, but not through nonspecific adhesions on their membrane. SMCs may behave differently depending on the sites through which they are stretched.},

In this study, the focus was on early responses to hyperosmotic stress- (NaCl and sorbitol) induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]cyt) increase, ion fluxes, and mitochondrial potential variations, and on their links in pathways leading to programmed cell death (PCD). By using BY-2 tobacco cells, it was shown that both NaCl- and sorbitol-induced PCD seemed to be dependent on superoxide anion (O2{\textperiodcentered}–) generation by NADPH-oxidase. In the case of NaCl, an early influx of sodium through non-selective cation channels participates in the development of PCD through mitochondrial dysfunction and NADPH-oxidase-dependent O2{\textperiodcentered}– generation. This supports the hypothesis of different pathways in NaCl- and sorbitol-induced cell death. Surprisingly, other shared early responses, such as [Ca2+]cyt increase and singlet oxygen production, do not seem to be involved in PCD.},

Here we show that ​BIN1/​M-Amphiphysin2, a protein involved in T-tubule biogenesis in muscle cells and frequently mutated in centronuclear myopathies, clusters PtdIns(4,5)P2 to recruit its downstream partner dynamin. By using several mutants associated with centronuclear myopathies, we find that the N-BAR and the SH3 domains of ​BIN1 control the kinetics and the accumulation of dynamin on membranes, respectively. We show that phosphoinositide clustering is a mechanism shared by other proteins that interact with PtdIns(4,5)P2, but do not contain a BAR domain. Our numerical simulations point out that clustering is a diffusion-driven process in which phosphoinositide molecules are not sequestered. We propose that this mechanism plays a key role in the recruitment of downstream phosphoinositide-binding proteins.},

In this framework we show that low chaotrope concentrations lead to a destabilization of the native state of proteins, and that high concentrations induce complete denaturation.

abstract = {The interplay between cadherin- and integrin-dependent signals controls cell behavior, but the precise mechanisms that regulate the strength of adhesion to the extracellular matrix remains poorly understood. We deposited cells expressing a defined repertoire of cadherins and integrins on fibronectin (FN)-coated polyacrylamide gels (FN-PAG) and on FN-coated pillars used as a micro-force sensor array ($\mu$FSA), and analyzed the functional relationship between these adhesion receptors to determine how it regulates cell traction force. We found that cadherin-mediated adhesion stimulated cell spreading on FN-PAG, and this was modulated by the substrate stiffness. We compared S180 cells with cells stably expressing different cadherins on $\mu$FSA and found that traction forces were stronger in cells expressing cadherins than in parental cells. E-cadherin-mediated contact and mechanical coupling between cells are required for this increase in cell-FN traction force, which was not observed in isolated cells, and required Src and PI3K activities. Traction forces were stronger in cells expressing type I cadherins than in cells expressing type II cadherins, which correlates with our previous observation of a higher intercellular adhesion strength developed by type I compared with type II cadherins. Our results reveal one of the mechanisms whereby molecular cross talk between cadherins and integrins upregulates traction forces at cell-FN adhesion sites, and thus provide additional insight into the molecular control of cell behavior.},

Here, we provide direct evidence for cooperative membrane recruitment of dynamin with the BIN/amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) proteins, endophilin and amphiphysin. Surprisingly, endophilin and amphiphysin recruitment to membranes was also dependent on binding to dynamin due to auto-inhibition of BAR-membrane interactions. Consistent with reciprocal recruitment in vitro, dynamin recruitment to the plasma membrane in cells was strongly reduced by concomitant depletion of endophilin and amphiphysin, and conversely, depletion of dynamin dramatically reduced the recruitment of endophilin. In addition, amphiphysin depletion was observed to severely inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Furthermore, GTP-dependent membrane scission by dynamin was dramatically elevated by BAR domain proteins. Thus, BAR domain proteins and dynamin act in synergy in membrane recruitment and GTP-dependent vesicle scission.},

abstract = {To explore the role of nonmuscle myosin II isoforms during mouse gametogenesis, fertilization, and early development, localization and microinjection studies were performed using monospecific antibodies to myosin IIA and IIB isotypes. Each myosin II antibody recognizes a 205-kDa protein in oocytes, but not mature sperm. Myosin IIA and IIB demonstrate differential expression during meiotic maturation and following fertilization: only the IIA isoform detects metaphase spindles or accumulates in the mitotic cleavage furrow. In the unfertilized oocyte, both myosin isoforms are polarized in the cortex directly overlying the metaphase-arrested second meiotic spindle. Cortical polarization is altered after spindle disassembly with Colcemid: the scattered meiotic chromosomes initiate myosin IIA and microfilament assemble in the vicinity of each chromosome mass. During sperm incorporation, both myosin II isotypes concentrate in the second polar body cleavage furrow and the sperm incorporation cone. In functional experiments, the microinjection of myosin IIA antibody disrupts meiotic maturation to metaphase II arrest, probably through depletion of spindle-associated myosin IIA protein and antibody binding to chromosome surfaces. Conversely, the microinjection of myosin IIB antibody blocks microfilament-directed chromosome scattering in Colcemid-treated mature oocytes, suggesting a role in mediating chromosome–cortical actomyosin interactions. Neither myosin II antibody, alone or coinjected, blocks second polar body formation, in vitro fertilization, or cytokinesis. Finally, microinjection of a nonphosphorylatable 20-kDa regulatory myosin light chain specifically blocks sperm incorporation cone disassembly and impedes cell cycle progression, suggesting that interference with myosin II phosphorylation influences fertilization. Thus, conventional myosins break cortical symmetry in oocytes by participating in eccentric meiotic spindle positioning, sperm incorporation cone dynamics, and cytokinesis. Although murine sperm do not express myosin II, different myosin II isotypes may have distinct roles during early embryonic development.},

abstract = {Cell-generated traction forces induce integrin activation, leading to focal adhesion growth and cell spreading. It remains unknown, however, whether integrin activation feeds back to impact the generation of cytoskeletal tension. Here, we used elastomeric micropost arrays to measure cellular traction forces in wildtype and integrin-null cells. We report that activation of $\beta$1 but not $\beta$3 integrin, by either increasing density of immobilized fibronectin or treating with manganese, elicited fibroblast spreading and cytoskeletal tension. Furthermore, this force generation required Rho kinase and myosin activity. These findings suggest that integrin activation and cell traction forces comprise a bi-directional signaling unit of cell adhesion.},

@article{Carvalho2013,
abstract = {Animal cells actively generate contractile stress in the actin cortex, a thin actin network beneath the cell membrane, to facilitate shape changes during processes like cytokinesis and motility. On the microscopic scale, this stress is generated by myosin molecular motors, which bind to actin cytoskeletal filaments and use chemical energy to exert pulling forces. To decipher the physical basis for the regulation of cell shape changes, here, we use a cell-like system with a cortex anchored to the outside or inside of a liposome membrane. This system enables us to dissect the interplay between motor pulling forces, cortex-membrane anchoring, and network connectivity. We show that cortices on the outside of liposomes either spontaneously rupture and relax built-up mechanical stress by peeling away around the liposome or actively compress and crush the liposome. The decision between peeling and crushing depends on the cortical tension determined by the amount of motors and also on the connectivity of the cortex and its attachment to the membrane. Membrane anchoring strongly affects the morphology of cortex contraction inside liposomes: cortices contract inward when weakly attached, whereas they contract toward the membrane when strongly attached. We propose a physical model based on a balance of active tension and mechanical resistance to rupture. Our findings show how membrane attachment and network connectivity are able to regulate actin cortex remodeling and membrane-shape changes for cell polarization.},

abstract = {The somatic gonad of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans contains a myoepithelial sheath, which surrounds oocytes and provides contractile forces during ovulation. Contractile apparatuses of the myoepithelial-sheath cells are non-striated and similar to those of smooth muscle. We report the identification of a specific isoform of actin depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin as an essential factor for assembly of contractile actin networks in the gonadal myoepithelial sheath. Two ADF/cofilin isoforms, UNC-60A and UNC-60B, are expressed from the unc-60 gene by alternative splicing. RNA interference of UNC-60A caused disorganization of the actin networks in the myoepithelial sheath. UNC-60B, which is known to function in the body-wall muscle, was not necessary or sufficient for actin organization in the myoepithelial sheath. However, mutant forms of UNC-60B with reduced actin-filament-severing activity rescued the UNC-60A-depletion phenotype. UNC-60A has a much weaker filament-severing activity than UNC-60B, suggesting that an ADF/cofilin with weak severing activity is optimal for assembly of actin networks in the myoepithelial sheath. By contrast, strong actin-filament-severing activity of UNC-60B was required for assembly of striated myofibrils in the body-wall muscle. Our results suggest that an optimal level of actin-filament-severing activity of ADF/cofilin is required for assembly of actin networks in the somatic gonad.},

In contrast, protein coats and their associated accessory proteins drive membrane bending using a variety of interdependent physical mechanisms. We survey the energy costs and drivers involved in membrane curvature, and draw a contrast between the stochastic contributions of molecular crowding and the deterministic assembly of protein coats. These basic principles also apply to other cellular examples of membrane bending events, including important disease-related problems such as viral egress.},

However, several relatively recent developments have added new impetus to wound repair research: the increasing application of model systems; the growing recognition that single cells have a robust, complex, and medically relevant wound healing response; and the emerging recognition that different modes of wound repair bear an uncanny resemblance to other basic biological processes such as morphogenesis and cytokinesis. In this review, each of these developments is described, and their significance for wound healing research is considered. In addition, overlapping mechanisms of single-cell and multicellular wound healing are highlighted, and it is argued that they are more similar than is often recognized. Based on this and other information, a simple model to explain the evolutionary relationships of cytokinesis, single-cell wound repair, multicellular wound repair, and developmental morphogenesis is proposed. Finally, a series of important, but as yet unanswered, questions is posed.},

Interactions between microtubules (MTs) and filamentous actin (f-actin) are involved in directed cell locomotion, but are poorly understood. To test the hypothesis that MTs and f-actin associate with one another and affect each other's organization and dynamics, we performed time-lapse dual-wavelength spinning-disk confocal fluorescent speckle microscopy (FSM) of MTs and f-actin in migrating newt lung epithelial cells. F-actin exhibited four zones of dynamic behavior: rapid retrograde flow in the lamellipodium, slow retrograde flow in the lamellum, anterograde flow in the cell body, and no movement in the convergence zone between the lamellum and cell body. Speckle analysis showed that MTs moved at the same trajectory and velocity as f-actin in the cell body and lamellum, but not in the lamellipodium or convergence zone. MTs grew along f-actin bundles, and quiescent MT ends moved in association with f-actin bundles. These results show that the movement and organization of f-actin has a profound effect on the dynamic organization of MTs in migrating cells, and suggest that MTs and f-actin bind to one another in vivo.},

Ambiguity and circularity surround any classification of microtubule polarity by conventional methods. Chlamydomonas flagellar axonemal pieces have distinct morphological differences at their plus- and minus-ends, and microtubules nucleated from these pieces can be distinguished as plus- or minus-ended based on the morphological differences present in the Chlamydomonas flagellar axonemal pieces. Plus- and minus-ended microtubules were polymerized in this fashion and analyzed for differences in growth rates, shortening rates, and frequencies of transitions. The results were in good agreement with similar data generated by the more time-consuming and difficult use of kinesin-coated beads (R. J. Kowalski, and R. C. Williams, Jr. (1993) Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton 26, 282-290) to determine microtubule polarity.

The mechanical microenvironment is known to influence single-cell migration; however, the extent to which mechanical cues affect collective migration of adherent cells is not well understood. We measured the effects of varying substrate compliance on individual cell migratory properties in an epithelial wound-healing assay. Increasing substrate stiffness increased collective cell migration speed, persistence, and directionality as well as the coordination of cell movements. Dynamic analysis revealed that wounding initiated a wave of motion coordination from the wound edge into the sheet. This was accompanied by a front-to-back gradient of myosin-II activation and establishment of cell polarity. The propagation was faster and farther reaching on stiff substrates, indicating that substrate stiffness affects the transmission of directional cues. Manipulation of myosin-II activity and cadherin–catenin complexes revealed that this transmission is mediated by coupling of contractile forces between neighboring cells. Thus, our findings suggest that the mechanical environment integrates in a feedback with cell contractility and cell–cell adhesion to regulate collective migration.},

However, it is unclear if connections between integrins and the ECM are immediately capable of transducing cytoskeletal contraction into migration force, or whether engagement of force transmission requires maturation of the adhesion. Here, we show that initial integrin-ECM adhesions become capable of exerting migration force with the recruitment of vinculin, a marker for focal complexes, which are precursors of focal adhesions. We are able to induce the development of focal complexes by the application of mechanical force to fibronectin receptors from inside or outside the cell, and we are able to extend focal complex formation to vitronectin receptors by the removal of c-Src. These results indicate that cells use mechanical force as a signal to strengthen initial integrin-ECM adhesions into focal complexes and regulate the amount of migration force applied to individual adhesions at localized regions of the advancing lamella.},

However, the resolution of these studies is insufficient to unveil how the endocytic machinery actually drives membrane deformation in vivo. In this study, we use quantitative immuno-EM to introduce the temporal dimension to the ultrastructural analysis of membrane budding and define changes in the topography of the lipid bilayer coupled to the dynamics of endocytic proteins with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution. Using this approach, we frame the emergence of membrane curvature with respect to the recruitment of endocytic factors and show that constriction of the invaginations correlates with translocation of membrane-sculpting proteins. Furthermore, we show that initial bending of the plasma membrane is independent of actin and clathrin polymerization and precedes building of an actin cap branched by the Arp2/3 complex. Finally, our data indicate that constriction and additional elongation of the endocytic profiles require the mechanochemical activity of the myosins-I. Altogether, this work provides major insights into the molecular mechanisms driving membrane deformation in a cellular context.},

abstract = {The mechanical properties of cells change as they proceed through the cell cycle, primarily owing to regulation of actin and myosin II. Most models for cell mechanics focus on actomyosin in the cortex and ignore possible roles in bulk cytoplasm. We explored cell cycle regulation of bulk cytoplasmic actomyosin in Xenopus egg extracts, which is almost undiluted cytoplasm from unfertilized eggs. We observed dramatic gelation-contraction of actomyosin in mitotic (M phase) extract where Cdk1 activity is high, but not in interphase (I-phase) extract. In spread droplets, M-phase extract exhibited regular, periodic pulses of gelation-contraction a few minutes apart that continued for many minutes. Comparing actin nucleation, disassembly and myosin II activity between M-phase and I-phase extracts, we conclude that regulation of nucleation is likely to be the most important for cell cycle regulation. We then imaged F-actin in early zebrafish blastomeres using a GFP-Utrophin probe. Polymerization in bulk cytoplasm around vesicles increased dramatically during mitosis, consistent with enhanced nucleation. We conclude that F-actin polymerization in bulk cytoplasm is cell cycle regulated in early vertebrate embryos and discuss possible biological functions of this regulation.},

abstract = {The mechanical properties of cells play an essential role in numerous physiological processes. Organized networks of semiflexible actin filaments determine cell stiffness and transmit force during mechanotransduction, cytokinesis, cell motility and other cellular shape changes. Although numerous actin-binding proteins have been identified that organize networks, the mechanical properties of actin networks with physiological architectures and concentrations have been difficult to measure quantitatively. Studies of mechanical properties in vitro have found that crosslinked networks of actin filaments formed in solution exhibit stress stiffening arising from the entropic elasticity of individual filaments or crosslinkers resisting extension. Here we report reversible stress-softening behaviour in actin networks reconstituted in vitro that suggests a critical role for filaments resisting compression. Using a modified atomic force microscope to probe dendritic actin networks (like those formed in the lamellipodia of motile cells), we observe stress stiffening followed by a regime of reversible stress softening at higher loads. This softening behaviour can be explained by elastic buckling of individual filaments under compression that avoids catastrophic fracture of the network. The observation of both stress stiffening and softening suggests a complex interplay between entropic and enthalpic elasticity in determining the mechanical properties of actin networks.},

abstract = {The application of fluorescence and electron microscopy to the same specimen allows the study of dynamic and rare cellular events at ultrastructural detail. Here, we present a correlative microscopy approach, which combines high accuracy of correlation, high sensitivity for detecting faint fluorescent signals, as well as robustness and reproducibility to permit large dataset collections. We provide a step-by-step protocol that allows direct mapping of fluorescent protein signals into electron tomograms. A localization precision of {\textless}100 nm is achieved by using fluorescent fiducial markers which are visible both in fluorescence images and in electron tomograms. We explain the critical details of the procedure, give background information on the individual steps, present results from test experiments carried out during establishment of the method, as well as information about possible modifications to the protocol, such as its application to 2D electron micrographs. This simple, robust, and flexible method can be applied to a large variety of cellular systems, such as yeast cell pellets and mammalian cell monolayers, to answer a broad spectrum of structure–function related questions.},

Here, evidence supporting the functional link between Vps1 and the yeast amphiphysin Rvs167 in vesicle invagination is discussed. Though the disassembly of endocytic factors from pinched-off endocytic vesicles appears to be tightly regulated in a spatiotemporal manner, we are far from having complete understanding of the underlying mechanism. In this study, we provide evidence that Vps1 plays a role in the uncoating of endocytic proteins from post-internalized vesicles, based on the observation of a quick disassembly of two endocytic coat proteins Ent1 and Ent2 in cells lacking Vps1.},

abstract = {Functional characterization of the genes of higher eukaryotes has been aided by their expression in model organisms and by analyzing site-specific changes in homologous genes in model systems such as the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Modifying sequences in yeast or other organisms such that no heterologous material is retained requires in vitro mutagenesis together with subcloning. PCR-based procedures that do not involve cloning are inefficient or require multistep reactions that increase the risk of additional mutations. An alternative approach, demonstrated in yeast, relies on transformation with an oligonucleotide, but the method is restricted to the generation of mutants with a selectable phenotype. Oligonucleotides, when combined with gap repair, have also been used to modify plasmids in yeast; however, this approach is limited by restriction-site availability. We have developed a mutagenesis approach in yeast based on transformation by unpurified oligonucleotides that allows the rapid creation of site-specific DNA mutations in vivo. A two-step, cloning-free process, referred to as delitto perfetto, generates products having only the desired mutation, such as a single or multiple base change, an insertion, a small or a large deletion, or even random mutations. The system provides for multiple rounds of mutation in a window up to 200 base pairs. The process is RAD52 dependent, is not constrained by the distribution of naturally occurring restriction sites, and requires minimal DNA sequencing. Because yeast is commonly used for random and selective cloning of genomic DNA from higher eukaryotes such as yeast artificial chromosomes, the delitto perfetto strategy also provides an efficient way to create precise changes in mammalian or other DNA sequences.},

Over two decades ago the Genetics Perspectives editors solicited a perspective on my participation in the studies that deciphered the mechanism of mating-type switching and revealed the phenomenon of gene silencing in yeast. Although flattered at the time, I thought that preparation of such an article called for a more seasoned researcher who had benefitted from seeing his contributions stand the test of time. Now realizing that our discovery of the transposition of a mutation from the HM$\alpha$ locus into the MAT (mating type) locus has provided the genetic evidence that established the gene transposition model, and having witnessed our conclusions confirmed by subsequent molecular studies, I decided that perhaps this is a good time to recount the chronology of events as they unfolded for me decades ago.},

Here, using a cell-free system, we provide direct morphological evidence in support of this hypothesis. Unexpectedly, we also find that amphiphysin-1, like dynamin-1, can transform spherical liposomes into narrow tubules. Moreover, amphiphysin-1 assembles with dynamin-1 into ring-like structures around the tubules and enhances the liposome-fragmenting activity of dynamin-1 in the presence of GTP. These results show that amphiphysin binds lipid bilayers, indicate a potential function for amphiphysin in the changes in bilayer curvature that accompany vesicle budding, and imply a close functional partnership between amphiphysin and dynamin in endocytosis.},

Among them the rvs161 mutant (RVS for Reduced Viability upon Starvation) is sensitive to carbon, nitrogen and sulphur starvation. When these nutrients are depleted in the medium, mutant cells show cellular viability loss with morphological changes. The mutation rvs161-1 is very pleiotropic, and besides the defects in stationary phase entry, the mutant strain presents other alterations: sensitivity to high salt concentrations, hypersensitivity to amino acid analogs, no growth on lactate or acetate medium. The addition of salts or amino acid analogs leads to the same morphological defects observed in starved cells, suggesting that the gene could be implicated mainly in the control of cellular viability. The gene RVS161 was cloned; it codes for a 30,252 daltons protein. No homology was detected with the proteins contained in the databases. Moreover, Southern analysis revealed the presence of other sequences homologous to the RVS161 gene in the yeast genome.},

abstract = {Amphiphysin I is an SH3 domain-containing neuronal protein, enriched in axon terminals, which was reported to act as a physiological binding partner for dynamin I in synaptic vesicle endocytosis. Rvs167 and Rvs161, the yeast homologs of amphiphysin I, have been implicated in endocytosis, actin function, and cell polarity. Now we have explored the possibility that amphiphysin I also may have a role in actin dynamics and cell polarity by testing the effect of amphiphysin I suppression on neurite outgrowth. Freshly plated hippocampal neurons were exposed to antisense oligonucleotides via a new delivery system based on a polycationic amphipathic polymer, PS980. Western blot analysis revealed that amphiphysin I levels steadily increased with neuronal differentiation, whereas in antisense-treated cultures amphiphysin I levels were reduced to approximately 10{\%} of control levels at 48 hr. Concomitantly, a collapse of growth cones and a severe inhibition of neurite outgrowth and axon formation were observed. A similar effect was observed previously after dynamin I suppression in the same culture system (). We also have found that amphiphysin I and dynamin I colocalize in developing neurons at all developmental stages and that a pool of both proteins is colocalized with actin patches at the leading edge of growth cones. Our findings suggest a conserved role of the amphiphysin protein family in the dynamics of the cortical cell cytoskeleton and provide new evidence for a close functional link between amphiphysin I and dynamin I.},

abstract = {BAR (Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs) adapter proteins have been suggested to regulate endocytosis, actin organization, apoptosis, and transcription, but their precise roles are obscure. There are at least five mammalian genes that encode BAR adapter proteins, including the evolutionarily conserved and ubiquitously expressed Bin1/Amphiphysin-II and Bin3 genes. Bin1 holds special interest as certain splice isoforms localize to the nucleus, interact with the c-Abl and c-Myc oncoproteins, and display tumor suppressor properties. To obtain functional insights, we embarked upon a genetic analysis of the two BAR adapter proteins expressed in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. In a previous work, a role in actin organization and cytokinesis was identified for the Bin3 homolog hob3+. In this study, a role in stress signaling was defined for the Bin1 homolog, hob1+. Notably, hob1+ was dispensable for endocytosis, actin organization, or osmotic sensitivity. Instead, mutation of hob1+ led to slight cell elongation and faulty cell cycle arrest upon nutrient starvation. These defects were complemented by Bin1, but not by Amphiphysin-I, arguing that these genes have distinct functions despite their structural similarity. hob1 delta mutant cells were also hypersensitive to genotoxic stress. This was not related to a faulty checkpoint response, but mutation in the checkpoint gene rad3(+) further exacerbated the sensitivity of hob1 delta mutant cells. Interestingly, mutation of the cell cycle regulator wee1+ partially relieved the sensitivity defect, suggesting that hob1+ may influence the efficiency of DNA repair or checkpoint release after DNA damage. Genetic and biochemical evidence indicated that hob3+ is epistatic to hob1+ in the response to genotoxic stress. Our findings indicate that the Bin1 homolog hob1+ participates in DNA damage signaling and they suggest a novel role for BAR adapter proteins in stress response processes.},

These genes were annotated, and a large portion could be assigned to putative functional categories associated with basic metabolic processes, such as energy-generating processes and the biosynthesis and degradation of cellular building blocks. We further demonstrate, through computational screens (e.g., against a Medicago truncatula database) and direct hybridization on genomic DNA of diverse plant species, that these COS markers also are conserved in the genomes of other plant families. Finally, we show that this gene set can be used for comparative mapping studies between highly divergent genomes such as those of tomato and Arabidopsis.

The actin cytoskeleton is an integral part of the cell cortex, and there is growing evidence that F-actin plays a direct role in these endocytic events. Genetic studies in yeast have firmly established a functional connection between actin and endocytosis. Identification of several proteins that may function at the interface between actin and the endocytic machinery has provided further evidence for this association in both yeast and mammalian cells. Several of these proteins are directly involved in regulating actin assembly and could thus harness forces produced during actin polymerization to facilitate specific steps in the endocytic process. Recent microscopy studies in mammalian cells provide powerful evidence that localized recruitment and polymerization of actin occurs at endocytic sites. In this review, we focus on progress made in elucidating the functions of the actin cytoskeleton in endocytosis.},

The following parameters were investigated: 1) maximum specific growth rate in shake-flask cultures; 2) biomass yields on glucose during growth on defined media in batch cultures and steady-state chemostat cultures under controlled conditions with respect to pH and dissolved oxygen concentration; 3) the critical specific growth rate above which aerobic fermentation becomes apparent in glucose-limited accelerostat cultures; 4) sporulation and mating efficiency; and 5) transformation efficiency via the lithium-acetate, bicine, and electroporation methods. On the basis of physiological as well as genetic properties, strains from the CEN.PK family were selected as a platform for cell-factory research on the stoichiometry and kinetics of growth and product formation.},

abstract = {Learning, defined as a change in behaviour evoked by experience, has hitherto been investigated almost exclusively in multicellular neural organisms. Evidence for learning in non-neural multicellular organisms is scant, and only a few unequivocal reports of learning have been described in single-celled organisms. Here we demonstrate habituation, an unmistakable form of learning, in the non-neural organism Physarum polycephalum. In our experiment, using chemotaxis as the behavioural output and quinine or caffeine as the stimulus, we showed that P. polycephalum learnt to ignore quinine or caffeine when the stimuli were repeated, but responded again when the stimulus was withheld for a certain time. Our results meet the principle criteria that have been used to demonstrate habituation: responsiveness decline and spontaneous recovery. To distinguish habituation from sensory adaptation or motor fatigue, we also show stimulus specificity. Our results point to the diversity of organisms lacking neurons, which likely display a hitherto unrecognized capacity for learning, and suggest that slime moulds may be an ideal model system in which to investigate fundamental mechanisms underlying learning processes. Besides, documenting learning in non-neural organisms such as slime moulds is centrally important to a comprehensive, phylogenetic understanding of when and where in the tree of life the earliest manifestations of learning evolved.},

@article{Choquet1997,
abstract = {To move forward, migrating cells must generate traction forces through surface receptors bound to extracellular matrix molecules coupled to a rigid structure. We investigated whether cells sample and respond to the rigidity of the anchoring matrix. Movement of beads coated with fibronectin or an anti-integrin antibody was restrained with an optical trap on fibroblasts to mimic extracellular attachment sites of different resistance. Cells precisely sense the restraining force on fibronectin beads and respond by a localized, proportional strengthening of the cytoskeleton linkages, allowing stronger force to be exerted on the integrins. This strengthening was absent or transient with antibody beads, but restored with soluble fibronectin. Hence, ligand binding site occupancy was required. Finally, phenylarsine oxide inhibited strengthening of cytoskeletal linkages, indicating a role for dephosphorylation. Thus, the strength of integrin–cytoskeleton linkages is dependent on matrix rigidity and on its biochemical composition. Matrix rigidity may, therefore, serve as a guidance cue in a process of mechanotaxis.},

The dynamin family consists of classical dynamins and dynamin-like proteins (DLPs). Due to structural and functional similarities DLPs are thought to carry out membrane tubulation and scission in a similar manner to dynamin. Here, we discuss the newly emerging roles for DLPs, which include vacuole fission and fusion, peroxisome maintenance, endocytosis and intracellular trafficking. Specific focus is given to the role of DLPs in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae because the diverse function of DLPs has been well characterized in this organism. Recent insights into DLPs may provide a better understanding of mammalian dynamin and its associated diseases.},

@article{Rodal2003a,
abstract = {Background: WASp family proteins promote actin filament assembly by activating Arp2/3 complex and are regulated spatially and temporally to assemble specialized actin structures used in diverse cellular processes. Some WASp family members are autoinhibited until bound by activating ligands; however, regulation of the budding yeast WASp homolog (Las17/Bee1) has not yet been explored.
Results: We isolated full-length Las17 and characterized its biochemical activities on yeast Arp2/3 complex. Purified Las17 was not autoinhibited; in this respect, it is more similar to SCAR/WAVE than to WASp proteins. Las17 was a much stronger activator of Arp2/3 complex than its carboxyl-terminal (WA) fragment. In addition, actin polymerization stimulated by Las17-Arp2/3 was much less sensitive to the inhibitory effects of profilin compared to polymerization stimulated by WA-Arp2/3. Two SH3 domain-containing binding partners of Las17, Sla1 and Bbc1, were purified and were shown to cooperate in inhibiting Las17 activity. The two SLA1 SH3 domains required for this inhibitory activity in vitro were also required in vivo, in combination with BBC1, for cell viability and normal actin organization.
Conclusions: Full-length Las17 is not autoinhibited and activates Arp2/3 complex more strongly than its WA domain alone, revealing an important role for the Las17 amino terminus in Arp2/3 complex activation. Two of the SH3 domain-containing ligands of Las17, Sla1 and Bbc1, cooperate to inhibit Las17 activity in vitro and are required for a shared function in actin organization in vivo. Our results show that, like SCAR/WAVE, WASp proteins can be controlled by negative regulation through the combined actions of multiple ligands.},

@article{Friesen2003,
abstract = {The yeast amphiphysin homologue Rvs167p plays a role in regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, endocytosis, and sporulation. Rvs167p is a phosphoprotein in vegetatively growing cells and shows increased phosphorylation upon treatment with mating pheromone. Previous work has shown that Rvs167p can be phosphorylated in vitro by the cyclin-dependent kinase Pho85p complexed with its cyclin Pcl2p. Using chymotryptic phosphopeptide mapping, we have identified the sites on which Rvs167p is phosphorylated in vitro by Pcl2p-Pho85p. We have shown that these same sites are phosphorylated in vivo during vegetative growth and that phosphorylation at two of these sites is Pcl-Pho85p dependent. In cells treated with mating pheromone, the MAP kinase Fus3p is needed for full phosphorylation of Rvs167p. Functional genomics and genetics experiments revealed that mutation of other actin cytoskeleton genes compromises growth of a strain in which phosphorylation of Rvs167p is blocked by mutation. Phosphorylation of Rvs167p inhibits its interaction in vitro with Las17p, an activator of the Arp2/3 complex, as well as with a novel protein, Ymr192p. Our results suggest that phosphorylation of Rvs167p by a cyclin-dependent kinase and by a MAP kinase is an important mechanism for regulating protein complexes involved in actin cytoskeleton function.},

@article{Hohmann2002,
abstract = {The ability to adapt to altered availability of free water is a fundamental property of living cells. The principles underlying osmoadaptation are well conserved. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an excellent model system with which to study the molecular biology and physiology of osmoadaptation. Upon a shift to high osmolarity, yeast cells rapidly stimulate a mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade, the high-osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway, which orchestrates part of the transcriptional response. The dynamic operation of the HOG pathway has been well studied, and similar osmosensing pathways exist in other eukaryotes. Protein kinase A, which seems to mediate a response to diverse stress conditions, is also involved in the transcriptional response program. Expression changes after a shift to high osmolarity aim at adjusting metabolism and the production of cellular protectants. Accumulation of the osmolyte glycerol, which is also controlled by altering transmembrane glycerol transport, is of central importance. Upon a shift from high to low osmolarity, yeast cells stimulate a different MAP kinase cascade, the cell integrity pathway. The transcriptional program upon hypo-osmotic shock seems to aim at adjusting cell surface properties. Rapid export of glycerol is an important event in adaptation to low osmolarity. Osmoadaptation, adjustment of cell surface properties, and the control of cell morphogenesis, growth, and proliferation are highly coordinated processes. The Skn7p response regulator may be involved in coordinating these events. An integrated understanding of osmoadaptation requires not only knowledge of the function of many uncharacterized genes but also further insight into the time line of events, their interdependence, their dynamics, and their spatial organization as well as the importance of subtle effects.},

However, the timing of its formation and turnover, and its specific functions at different stages during endocytic internalization, have not been established. In this study, Sla2 ANTH-GFP and Sjl2-3GFP were expressed as functional fusion proteins at endogenous levels to quantitatively explore PtdIns(4,5)P(2) dynamics during endocytosis in yeast. Our results indicate that PtdIns(4,5)P(2) levels increase and decline in conjunction with coat and actin assembly and disassembly, respectively. Live-cell image analysis of endocytic protein dynamics in an sjl1Delta sjl2Delta mutant, which has elevated PtdIns(4,5)P(2) levels, revealed that the endocytic machinery is still able to assemble and disassemble dynamically, albeit nonproductively. The defects in the dynamic behavior of the various endocytic proteins in this double mutant suggest that PtdIns(4,5)P(2) turnover is required for multiple stages during endocytic vesicle formation. Furthermore, our results indicate that PtdIns(4,5)P(2) turnover may act in coordination with the Ark1/Prk1 protein kinases in stimulating disassembly of the endocytic machinery.},

abstract = {BAR proteins are involved in a variety of membrane remodeling events but how they can mold membranes into different shapes remains poorly understood. Using electron paramagnetic resonance, we find that vesicle binding of the N-BAR protein amphiphysin is predominantly mediated by the shallow insertion of amphipathic N-terminal helices. In contrast, the interaction with tubes involves deeply inserted N-terminal helices together with the concave surface of the BAR domain, which acts as a scaffold. Combined with the observed concentration dependence of tubulation and BAR domain scaffolding, the data indicate that initial membrane deformations and vesicle binding are mediated by insertion of amphipathic helical wedges, while tubulation requires high protein densities at which oligomeric BAR domain scaffolds form. In addition, we identify a pocket of residues on the concave surface of the BAR domain that insert deeply into tube membrane. Interestingly, this pocket harbors a number of disease mutants in the homologous amphiphysin 2.},

abstract = {Experiments were carried out to determine the origin of cortical polarity in mouse eggs and its possible relation to the meiotic apparatus. Cortices of mature eggs overlying the meiotic apparatus (microvillus-free area) were distinguished by an absence of microvilli and a thickened layer of actin. In contrast, the surfaces of immature oocytes were covered entirely with a dense population of microvilli and were subtended by a uniform layer of actin. When induced to undergo maturation, meiotic spindles formed in the center of immature oocytes and then moved peripherally. Coincident with the cortical localization of the meiotic spindle was the formation of a microvillus-free area, i.e., a loss of microvilli and a thickening of the actin layer associated with this region of the egg cortex. If immature oocytes were incubated in cytochalasin B, meiotic spindles formed; however, they failed to move peripherally and microvillus-free areas did not develop. Oocytes incubated in colchicine did not form meiotic spindles, although the chromosomes condensed and became localized to cortices where microvillus-free areas developed. Cytochalasin B-treated mature eggs maintained intact meiotic spindles and exhibited a disappearance of microvillus-free areas and a reduction in cortical actin. The chromosomes of mature eggs treated with colchicine remained associated with microvillus-free areas despite the disappearance of meiotic spindles. Occasionally, colchicine-treated eggs possessed more than one cortically located mass of chromosomes, each of which was associated with a microvillus-free area. These observations indicate that mechanisms involving the movement of the meiotic spindle to the oocyte cortex and development and maintenance of cortical polarity are cytochalasin B sensitive. Commensurate with the localization of meiotic chromosomes to the egg cortex is the reorganization of cortical actin and the formation of a microvillus-free area.},

abstract = {Expression of the GAL1 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is strongly repressed by growth on glucose. We show that two sites within the GAL1 promoter mediate glucose repression. First, glucose inhibits transcription activation by GAL4 protein through UASG. Second, a promoter element, termed URSG, confers glucose repression independently of GAL4. We have localized the URSG sequences responsible for glucose repression to an 87-base-pair fragment located between UASG and the TATA box. Promoters deleted for small (20-base-pair) segments that span this sequence are still subject to glucose repression, suggesting that there are multiple sequences within this region that confer repression. Extended deletions across this region confirm that it contains at least two and possibly three URSG elements. To identify the gene products that confer repression upon UASG and URSG, we have analyzed glucose repression mutants and found that the GAL83, REG1, GRR1, and SSN6 genes are required for repression mediated by both UASG and URSG. In contrast, GAL82 and HXK2 are required only for UASG repression. A mutation designated urr1-1 (URSG repression resistant) was identified that specifically relieves URSG repression without affecting UASG repression. In addition, we observed that the SNF1-encoded protein kinase is essential for derepression of both UASG and URSG. We propose that repression of UASG and URSG is mediated by two independent pathways that respond to a common signal generated by growth on glucose.},

abstract = {During cell locomotion and endocytosis, membrane-tethered WASP proteins stimulate actin filament nucleation by the Arp2/3 complex. This process generates highly branched arrays of filaments that grow toward the membrane to which they are tethered, a conflict that seemingly would restrict filament growth. Using three-color single-molecule imaging in vitro we revealed how the dynamic associations of Arp2/3 complex with mother filament and WASP are temporally coordinated with initiation of daughter filament growth. We found that WASP proteins dissociated from filament-bound Arp2/3 complex prior to new filament growth. Further, mutations that accelerated release of WASP from filament-bound Arp2/3 complex proportionally accelerated branch formation. These data suggest that while WASP promotes formation of pre-nucleation complexes, filament growth cannot occur until it is triggered by WASP release. This provides a mechanism by which membrane-bound WASP proteins can stimulate network growth without restraining it. DOI:http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01008.001.},

abstract = {Dynamins are a conserved family of proteins involved in membrane fusion and fission. Although mammalian dynamins are known to be involved in several membrane-trafficking events, the role of dynamin-1 in endocytosis is the best-characterised role of this protein family. Despite many similarities between endocytosis in yeast and mammalian cells, a comparable role for dynamins in yeast has not previously been demonstrated. The reported lack of involvement of dynamins in yeast endocytosis has raised questions over the general applicability of the current yeast model of endocytosis, and has also precluded studies using well-developed methods in yeast, to further our understanding of the mechanism of dynamin function during endocytosis. Here, we investigate the yeast dynamin-like protein Vps1 and demonstrate a transient burst of localisation to sites of endocytosis. Using live-cell imaging of endocytic reporters in strains lacking vps1, and also electron microscopy and biochemical approaches, we demonstrate a role for Vps1 in facilitating endocytic invagination. Vps1 mutants were generated, and analysis in several assays reveals a role for the C-terminal self-assembly domain in endocytosis but not in other membrane fission events with which Vps1 has previously been associated.},

abstract = {Most nucleated cells crawl about by extending a pseudopod that is driven by the polymerization of actin filaments in the cytoplasm behind the leading edge of the plasma membrane. These actin filaments are linked into a network by Y-branches, with the pointed end of each filament attached to the side of another filament and the rapidly growing barbed end facing forward. Because Arp2/3 complex nucleates actin polymerization and links the pointed end to the side of another filament in vitro, a dendritic nucleation model has been proposed in which Arp2/3 complex initiates filaments from the sides of older filaments. Here we report, by using a light microscopy assay, many new features of the mechanism. Branching occurs during, rather than after, nucleation by Arp2/3 complex activated by the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) or Scar protein; capping protein and profilin act synergistically with Arp2/3 complex to favour branched nucleation; phosphate release from aged actin filaments favours dissociation of Arp2/3 complex from the pointed ends of filaments; and branches created by Arp2/3 complex are relatively rigid. These properties result in the automatic assembly of the branched actin network after activation by proteins of the WASP/Scar family and favour the selective disassembly of proximal regions of the network.},

Stress-inducible Ssa3p and Ssa4p are 80{\%} identical to Ssa1/2p. We show Ssa1p-4p have distinct functions affecting [PSI+] and [URE3] prions. When expressed as the only Ssa, Ssa1p antagonized [URE3] and Ssa2p antagonized [PSI+]. Ssa3p and Ssa4p influenced [URE3] and [PSI+] somewhat differently but overall their effects paralleled those of Ssa1p and Ssa2p, respectively. Additionally, Ssa3p suppressed a prion-inhibitory effect of elevated temperature. Our previously described Ssa1-21p mutant weakens [PSI+] in SSA1-21 SSA2 cells and abolishes it in SSA1-21 ssa2$\Delta$ cells. To test if the same mutation affected other prions or altered Ssa2p similarly, we compared effects of a constructed Ssa2-21p mutant and Ssa1-21p on both prions. Surprisingly, [URE3] was unaffected in SSA1-21 SSA2 cells and could propagate in SSA1-21 ssa2$\Delta$ cells. Ssa2-21p impaired [URE3] considerably and weakened [PSI+] strongly but in a manner distinct from Ssa1-21p, highlighting functional differences between these nearly identical Hsp70's. Our data uncover exquisite functional differences among isoforms of a highly homologous cytosolic Hsp70 subfamily and point to a possibility that variations in Hsp70 function that might improve fitness under optimal conditions are also important during stress.},

abstract = {Summary
The GTPase dynamin, a key player in endocytic membrane fission, interacts with numerous proteins that regulate actin dynamics and generate/sense membrane curvature. To determine the functional relationship between these proteins and dynamin, we have analyzed endocytic intermediates that accumulate in cells that lack dynamin (derived from dynamin 1 and 2 double conditional knockout mice). In these cells, actin-nucleating proteins, actin, and BAR domain proteins accumulate at the base of arrested endocytic clathrin-coated pits, where they support the growth of dynamic long tubular necks. These results, which we show reflect the sequence of events in wild-type cells, demonstrate a concerted action of these proteins prior to, and independent of, dynamin and emphasize similarities between clathrin-mediated endocytosis in yeast and higher eukaryotes. Our data also demonstrate that the relationship between dynamin and actin is intimately connected to dynamin's endocytic role and that dynamin terminates a powerful actin- and BAR protein-dependent tubulating activity.},

Clathrin- and actin-mediated endocytosis in yeast has proven a very powerful model to study this process, with more than 60 evolutionarily conserved proteins involved in fashioning primary endocytic vesicles. Major progress in the field has been made during the last decades by defining the sequential recruitment of the endocytic machinery at the cell cortex using live-cell fluorescence microscopy. Higher spatial resolution has been recently achieved by developing time-resolved electron microscopy methods, allowing for the first time the visualization of changes in the plasma membrane shape, coupled to the dynamics of the endocytic machinery. Here, we highlight these advances and review recent findings from yeast and mammals that have increased our understanding of where and how endocytic proteins may apply force to remodel the plasma membrane during different stages of the process.},

@article{Soulard2002a,
abstract = {In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the WASP (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein) homologue Las17p (also called Bee1p) is an important component of cortical actin patches. Las17p is part of a high-molecular-weight protein complex that regulates Arp2/3 complex-dependent actin polymerization at the cell cortex and that includes the type I myosins Myo3p and Myo5p and verprolin (Vrp1p). To identify other factors implicated with this complex in actin regulation, we isolated proteins that bind to Las17p by two-hybrid screening and affinity chromatography. Here, we report the characterization of Lsb7/Bzz1p (for Las seventeen binding protein 7), an Src homology 3 (SH3) domain protein that interacts directly with Las17p via a polyproline-SH3 interaction. Bzz1p coimmunoprecipitates in a complex with Las17p, Vrp1p, Myo3/5p, Bbc1p, Hsp70p, and actin. It colocalizes with cortical actin patches and with Las17p. This localization is dependent on Las17p, but not on F-actin. Bzz1p interacts physically and genetically with type I myosins. While deletion of BZZ1 shows no obvious phenotype, simultaneous deletion of the BZZ1, MYO3, and MYO5 genes is lethal. Overexpression of Bzz1p inhibits cell growth, and a bzz1$\Delta$ myo5$\Delta$ double mutant is unable to restore actin polarity after NaCl stress. Finally, Bzz1p in vitro is able to recruit a functional actin polymerization machinery through its SH3 domains. Its interactions with Las17p, Vrp1p, and the type I myosins are essential for this process. This suggests that Bzz1p could be implicated in the regulation of actin polymerization.},

abstract = {Vesicle formation is accompanied by dramatic changes in membrane geometry. The role of the BAR domain proteins in membrane shaping—with a focus on how their structural features are optimized for this function—is explained here., Against the odds of membrane resistance, members of the BIN/Amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain superfamily shape membranes and their activity is indispensable for a plethora of life functions. While crystal structures of different BAR dimers advanced our understanding of membrane shaping by scaffolding and hydrophobic insertion mechanisms considerably, especially life-imaging techniques and loss-of-function studies of clathrin-mediated endocytosis with its gradually increasing curvature show that the initial idea that solely BAR domain curvatures determine their functions is oversimplified. Diagonal placing, lateral lipid-binding modes, additional lipid-binding modules, tilde shapes and formation of macromolecular lattices with different modes of organisation and arrangement increase versatility. A picture emerges, in which BAR domain proteins create macromolecular platforms, that recruit and connect different binding partners and ensure the connection and coordination of the different events during the endocytic process, such as membrane invagination, coat formation, actin nucleation, vesicle size control, fission, detachment and uncoating, in time and space, and may thereby offer mechanistic explanations for how coordination, directionality and effectiveness of a complex process with several steps and key players can be achieved.},

abstract = {Clathrin is a coat protein involved in vesicle budding from several membrane-bound compartments within the cell. Here we present an analysis of a temperature-sensitive (ts) mutant of clathrin heavy chain (CHC) in a multicellular animal. As expected Caenorhabditis elegans chc-1(b1025ts) mutant animals are defective in receptor-mediated endocytosis and arrest development soon after being shifted to the restrictive temperature. Steady-state clathrin levels in these mutants are reduced by more than 95{\%} at all temperatures. Hub interactions and membrane associations are lost at the restrictive temperature. chc-1(b1025ts) animals become paralyzed within minutes of exposure to the restrictive temperature because of a defect in the nervous system. Surprisingly synaptic vesicle number is not reduced in chc-1(b1025ts) animals. Consistent with the normal number of vesicles, postsynaptic miniature currents occur at normal frequencies. Taken together, these results indicate that a high level of CHC activity is required for receptor-mediated endocytosis in nonneuronal cells but is largely dispensable for maintenance of synaptic vesicle pools.},

abstract = {The Candida albicans plasma membrane plays critical roles in growth and virulence and as a target for antifungal drugs. Three C. albicans genes that encode Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs homology domain proteins were mutated to define their roles in plasma membrane function. The deletion of RVS161 and RVS167, but not RVS162, caused strong defects. The rvs161$\Delta$ mutant was more defective in endocytosis and morphogenesis than rvs167$\Delta$, but both were strongly defective in polarizing actin patches. Other plasma membrane constituents were still properly localized, including a filipin-stained domain at the hyphal tips. An analysis of growth under different in vitro conditions showed that the rvs161$\Delta$ and rvs167$\Delta$ mutants grew less invasively in agar and also suggested that they have defects in cell wall synthesis and Rim101 pathway signaling. These mutants were also more resistant to the antimicrobial peptide histatin 5 but showed essentially normal responses to the drugs caspofungin and amphotericin. Surprisingly, the rvs161$\Delta$ mutant was more sensitive to fluconazole, whereas the rvs167$\Delta$ mutant was more resistant, indicating that these mutations cause overlapping but distinct effects on cells. The rvs161$\Delta$ and rvs167$\Delta$ mutants both showed greatly reduced virulence in mice. However, the mutants were capable of growing to high levels in kidneys. Histological analyses of infected kidneys revealed that these rvs$\Delta$ mutants grew in a large fungal mass that was walled off by leukocytes, rather than forming disseminated microabscesses as seen for the wild type. The diminished virulence is likely due to a combination of the morphogenesis defects that reduce invasive growth and altered cell wall construction that exposes proinflammatory components to the host immune system.},

abstract = {Actomyosin networks linked to the micro-environment through the plasma membrane are thought to be key players in regulating cell behaviors within multicellular tissues, such as converging and extending mesoderm. Here, we observe the dynamics of actin contractions called 'punctuated actin contractions' in the mid-cell body of embryonic mesenchymal cells in the mesoderm. These contraction dynamics are a common feature of Xenopus embryonic tissues and are important for cell shape changes during morphogenesis. Quantitative morphological analysis of these F-actin dynamics indicates that frequent and aligned movements of multiple actin contractions accompany mesoderm cells as they intercalate and elongate. Using inhibitors combined with fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) analysis, we find that the dynamics of actin contractions are regulated by both myosin contractility and F-actin polymerization. Furthermore, we find that the non-canonical Wnt-signaling pathway permissively regulates levels of punctuated actin contractions. Overexpression of Xfz7 (Fzd7) can induce early maturation of actin contractions in mesoderm and produce mesoderm-like actin contractions in ectoderm cells. By contrast, expression of the dominant-negative Xenopus disheveled construct Xdd1 blocks the progression of actin contractions into their late mesoderm dynamics but has no effect in ectoderm. Our study reveals punctuated actin contractions within converging and extending mesoderm and uncovers a permissive role for non-canonical Wnt-signaling, myosin contractility and F-actin polymerization in regulating these dynamics.},

Even in its simplest form, endocytosis involves a large number of proteins with often redundant functions that are organized into a microscopic force-producing “machine”. Knowing how much force is needed to induce a membrane invagination is essential to understand how this endocytic machine may operate. We show that experimental membrane shapes are well described theoretically by a thin sheet elastic model including a difference of pressure across the membrane due to turgor. This allows us to integrate the different contributions that shape the membrane, and to compute the forces opposing membrane deformation. This calculation provides an estimate of the pulling force that must be generated by the actin machinery in yeast. We also identify a membrane instability that could lead to vesicle budding.},

The severe neonatal X-linked form (myotubular myopathy) is due to mutations in the phosphoinositide phosphatase myotubularin (MTM1), whereas mutations in dynamin 2 (DNM2) have been found in some autosomal dominant cases. By direct sequencing of functional candidate genes, we identified homozygous mutations in amphiphysin 2 (BIN1) in three families with autosomal recessive inheritance. Two missense mutations affecting the BAR (Bin1/amphiphysin/RVS167) domain disrupt its membrane tubulation properties in transfected cells, and a partial truncation of the C-terminal SH3 domain abrogates the interaction with DNM2 and its recruitment to the membrane tubules. Our results suggest that mutations in BIN1 cause centronuclear myopathy by interfering with remodeling of T tubules and/or endocytic membranes, and that the functional interaction between BIN1 and DNM2 is necessary for normal muscle function and positioning of nuclei.},

abstract = {Basic mechanisms by which cellular barriers sense and respond to integrity disruptions remain poorly understood. Despite its tenuous structure and constitutive exposure to disruptive strains, the vascular endothelium exhibits robust barrier function. We show that in response to micrometer-scale disruptions induced by transmigrating leukocytes, endothelial cells generate unique ventral lamellipodia that propagate via integrins toward and across these "micro-wounds" to close them. This novel actin remodeling activity progressively healed multiple micro-wounds in succession and changed direction during this process. Mechanical probe-induced micro-wounding of both endothelia and epithelia suggests that ventral lamellipodia formed as a response to force imbalance and specifically loss of isometric tension. Ventral lamellipodia were enriched in the Rac1 effectors cortactin, IQGAP, and p47Phox and exhibited localized production of hydrogen peroxide. Together with Apr2/3, these were functionally required for effective micro-wound healing. We propose that barrier disruptions are detected as local release of isometric tension/force unloading, which is directly coupled to reactive oxygen species-dependent self-restorative actin remodeling dynamics.},

abstract = {Tagging of genes by chromosomal integration of PCR amplified cassettes is a widely used and fast method to label proteins in vivo in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This strategy directs the amplified tags to the desired chromosomal loci due to flanking homologous sequences provided by the PCR-primers, thus enabling the selective introduction of any sequence at any place of a gene, e.g. for the generation of C-terminal tagged genes or for the exchange of the promoter and N-terminal tagging of a gene. To make this method most powerful we constructed a series of 76 novel cassettes, containing a broad variety of C-terminal epitope tags as well as nine different promoter substitutions in combination with N-terminal tags. Furthermore, new selection markers have been introduced. The tags include the so far brightest and most yeast-optimized version of the red fluorescent protein, called RedStar2, as well as all other commonly used fluorescent proteins and tags used for the detection and purification of proteins and protein complexes. Using the provided cassettes for N- and C-terminal gene tagging or for deletion of any given gene, a set of only four primers is required, which makes this method very cost-effective and reproducible. This new toolbox should help to speed up the analysis of gene function in yeast, on the level of single genes, as well as in systematic approaches.},

Rga7p is not required for the constriction of the contractile ring but does participate in the transport of a $\beta$-glucan synthetase Bgs4p from the late Golgi compartments to the plasma membrane adjacent to the contractile ring. Cells without Rga7p moved Bgs4p normally from the poles to the Golgi apparatus near the cell center, but Bgs4p then moved slowly from the late Golgi compartments to the cleavage site. The late arrival and lower than normal numbers of Bgs4p result in septal defects late in cytokinesis and lysis of separating cells similar to cells with the mutations in the cwg1(+) gene encoding Bgs4p.},

abstract = {Cell spreading was controlled independently of the amount and density of immobilized integrin ligand by culturing cells on single adhesive islands of different sizes (100–2500 $\mu$m2) and shapes (squares, circles, and lines) or on many smaller (3–5 $\mu$m diameter) circular islands that were coated with a saturating density of fibronectin and separated by non-adhesive regions. The amount of focal adhesions (FAs) containing vinculin and phosphotyrosine increased in direct proportion to cell spreading under all conditions. FAs localized asymmetrically along the periphery of the small islands that experienced highest tensional stress, and FA staining increased when cytoskeletal tension was stimulated with thrombin, whereas inhibitors of contractility promoted FA disassembly. Thus, these findings demonstrate the existence of an “inside-out” mechanism whereby global cell distortion produces increases in cytoskeletal tension that feed back to drive local changes in FA assembly. This complex interplay between cell morphology, mechanics, and adhesion may be critical to how cells integrate from and function in living tissues.},

The technique involves the creation of a rigid mold consisting of arrays of circular holes into which a thin layer of Au is deposited while the top surface of the mold and the sidewalls of the holes are protected by a sacrificial layer of Cr. When an elastomer is formed in the mold, the Au adheres to the tops of the molded pillars. This can then be selectively functionalized with a protein that induces cell adhesion, while the rest of the surface is treated with a repellent substance. An additional benefit is that the tops of the pillars can be fluorescently labeled for improved accuracy in force transduction measurements.},

The study of protein interactions in living cells is of particular significance because the interactions that occur in a particular cell depend on the full complement of proteins present in the cell and the external stimuli that influence the cell. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) analysis enables direct visualization of protein interactions in living cells. The BiFC assay is based on the association between two nonfluorescent fragments of a fluorescent protein when they are brought in proximity to each other by an interaction between proteins fused to the fragments. Numerous protein interactions have been visualized using the BiFC assay in many different cell types and organisms. The BiFC assay is technically straightforward and can be performed using standard molecular biology and cell culture reagents and a regular fluorescence microscope or flow cytometer.},

The motors, however, soften the zero-frequency elastic constant of the gel. When the collective motor dynamics is incorporated in the model, a stiffening of the network at high frequencies is obtained. The frequency controlling the crossover between low- and high-frequency network elasticity is estimated in terms of microscopic properties of motors and filaments, and can be as low as 10−3 Hz.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: WASp family proteins promote actin filament assembly by activating Arp2/3 complex and are regulated spatially and temporally to assemble specialized actin structures used in diverse cellular processes. Some WASp family members are autoinhibited until bound by activating ligands; however, regulation of the budding yeast WASp homolog (Las17/Bee1) has not yet been explored.
RESULTS: We isolated full-length Las17 and characterized its biochemical activities on yeast Arp2/3 complex. Purified Las17 was not autoinhibited; in this respect, it is more similar to SCAR/WAVE than to WASp proteins. Las17 was a much stronger activator of Arp2/3 complex than its carboxyl-terminal (WA) fragment. In addition, actin polymerization stimulated by Las17-Arp2/3 was much less sensitive to the inhibitory effects of profilin compared to polymerization stimulated by WA-Arp2/3. Two SH3 domain-containing binding partners of Las17, Sla1 and Bbc1, were purified and were shown to cooperate in inhibiting Las17 activity. The two SLA1 SH3 domains required for this inhibitory activity in vitro were also required in vivo, in combination with BBC1, for cell viability and normal actin organization.
CONCLUSIONS: Full-length Las17 is not autoinhibited and activates Arp2/3 complex more strongly than its WA domain alone, revealing an important role for the Las17 amino terminus in Arp2/3 complex activation. Two of the SH3 domain-containing ligands of Las17, Sla1 and Bbc1, cooperate to inhibit Las17 activity in vitro and are required for a shared function in actin organization in vivo. Our results show that, like SCAR/WAVE, WASp proteins can be controlled by negative regulation through the combined actions of multiple ligands.},

abstract = {The essential calmodulin genes in both Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe were precisely replaced with genes encoding fusions between calmodulin and the green fluorescent protein (GFP). In living budding yeast the GFP-calmodulin fusion protein (GFP-Cmd1p) localized simultaneously to sites of cell growth and to the spindle pole body (SPB), the yeast analog of the centrosome. Having demonstrated proper localization of GFP-calmodulin in budding yeast, we examined the localization of a fusion between GFP and calmodulin (GFP-Camlp) in fission yeast, where calmodulin had not been localized by any method. We find GFP-Camlp also localizes both to sites of polarized cell growth and to the fission yeast SPB. The localization of calmodulin to the SPB by GFP fusion was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence. Antiserum to S. pombe calmodulin labeled the ends of the mitotic spindle stained with anti-tubulin antiserum. This pattern was identical to that seen using antiserum to Sad1p, a known SPB component. We then characterized the defects in a temperature-sensitive S. pombe calmodulin mutant. Mutant cam1-E14 cells synchronized in S phase completed DNA synthesis, but lost viability during transit of mitosis. Severe defects in chromosome segregation, including hypercondensation, fragmentation, and unequal allocation of chromosomal material were observed. Immunofluorescence analysis of tubulin revealed a population of cells containing either broken or mislocalized mitotic spindles, which were never observed in wild-type cells. Taken together with the subcellular localization of calmodulin, the observed spindle and chromosome segregation defects suggest that calmodulin performs an essential role during mitosis at the fission yeast SPB.},

abstract = {Cell free extracts prepared from Xenopus eggs are one of the most powerful in vitro systems to analyze cell cycle-regulated mechanisms such as DNA replication, nuclear assembly, chromosome condensation, or spindle formation. Xenopus embryos can complete several synchronous cell cycles in the absence of transcription, consequently Xenopus extracts are very helpful to study the molecular level of cellular mechanisms. Many key cell cycle regulators like p34cdc2 and cdk2 have been discovered and characterized using those extracts, but their regulation during somatic cell cycles have only been studied in mammalian cultured cells. In this paper, we describe optimized conditions to obtain cell cycle arrested Xenopus XL2 cultured cells. Synchronization of XL2 cells at different stages of the cell cycle was achieved by serum starvation and drug treatments such as aphidicolin, nocodazole, and ALLN. The degree of synchronization was assessed by indirect fluorescence microscopy and FACS analysis. This method was used to study the cell cycle expression of the Xenopus kinesin-related protein, XlEg5, a microtubule-based motor protein involved in movement and cell division in early development. We found that the expression of the protein was maximum in mitosis and minimum in G1, which correlated with the expression of its messenger RNA. XL2 cultured cells were also used to analyze the ultrastructural sub-cellular localization of XlEg5. During mitosis, the protein was found around the centrosome in prophase, on the spindle microtubules in metaphase, and, interestingly, around the minus end of the midbody microtubules in telophase.},

Live-cell imaging shows that addition of sorbitol to the medium significantly accelerates early steps in the endocytic process and rescues defects of endocytic mutants in fission yeast., Yeast and other walled cells possess high internal turgor pressure that allows them to grow and survive in the environment. This turgor pressure, however, may oppose the invagination of the plasma membrane needed for endocytosis. Here we study the effects of turgor pressure on endocytosis in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe by time-lapse imaging of individual endocytic sites. Decreasing effective turgor pressure by addition of sorbitol to the media significantly accelerates early steps in the endocytic process before actin assembly and membrane ingression but does not affect the velocity or depth of ingression of the endocytic pit in wild-type cells. Sorbitol also rescues endocytic ingression defects of certain endocytic mutants and of cells treated with a low dose of the actin inhibitor latrunculin A. Endocytosis proceeds after removal of the cell wall, suggesting that the cell wall does not contribute mechanically to this process. These studies suggest that endocytosis is governed by a mechanical balance between local actin-dependent inward forces and opposing forces from high internal turgor pressure on the plasma membrane.},

In this review, we review the current understanding of the mechanics of F-actin networks and identify areas of further research needed to establish physical models. We first review our understanding of the mechanical behaviors of F-actin networks reconstituted in vitro, with a focus on the nonlinear mechanical response and behavior of "active" F-actin networks. We then explore the types of mechanical response measured of cytoskeletal F-actin networks and bundles formed in living cells and identify how these measurements correspond to those performed on reconstituted F-actin networks formed in vitro. Together, these approaches identify the challenges and opportunities in the study of living cytoskeletal matter.},

abstract = {Apical constriction facilitates epithelial sheet bending and invagination during morphogenesis. Apical constriction is conventionally thought to be driven by the continuous purse-string-like contraction of a circumferential actin and non-muscle myosin-II (myosin) belt underlying adherens junctions. However, it is unclear whether other force-generating mechanisms can drive this process. Here we show, with the use of real-time imaging and quantitative image analysis of Drosophila gastrulation, that the apical constriction of ventral furrow cells is pulsed. Repeated constrictions, which are asynchronous between neighbouring cells, are interrupted by pauses in which the constricted state of the cell apex is maintained. In contrast to the purse-string model, constriction pulses are powered by actin-myosin network contractions that occur at the medial apical cortex and pull discrete adherens junction sites inwards. The transcription factors Twist and Snail differentially regulate pulsed constriction. Expression of snail initiates actin-myosin network contractions, whereas expression of twist stabilizes the constricted state of the cell apex. Our results suggest a new model for apical constriction in which a cortical actin-myosin cytoskeleton functions as a developmentally controlled subcellular ratchet to reduce apical area incrementally.},

However, these models are not mutually exclusive and subsequent studies have provided evidence for both dynamin functions.

Morphological stages of vesicle formation are mirrored by progression through various protein modules (complexes). The process involves the formation of a putative FCH domain only (FCHO) initiation complex, which matures through adaptor protein 2 (AP2)-dependent cargo selection, and subsequent coat building, dynamin-mediated scission and finally auxilin- and heat shock cognate 70 (HSC70)-dependent uncoating.

While BAR domain proteins such as endo-philin have been reported in dynamin-independent scission of tubular membrane necks, the cutting mechanism has yet to be deciphered. Here, we combine a theoretical model, in vitro, and in vivo experiments revealing how protein scaffolds may cut tubular membranes. We demonstrate that the protein scaffold bound to the underlying tube creates a frictional barrier for lipid diffusion; tube elongation thus builds local membrane tension until the membrane undergoes scission through lysis. We call this mechanism friction-driven scission (FDS). In cells, motors pull tubes, particularly during endocy-tosis. Through reconstitution, we show that motors not only can pull out and extend protein-scaffolded tubes but also can cut them by FDS. FDS is generic, operating even in the absence of amphipathic helices in the BAR domain, and could in principle apply to any high-friction protein and membrane assembly.},

abstract = {Rvs167 and Rvs161 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are amphiphysin family proteins, which are involved in several important cellular events, such as invagination and scission of endocytic vesicles, and actin cytoskeleton organization. It has been reported that cellular dysfunctions caused by deletion of RVS167 or RVS161 are rescued by deletion of specific nonessential sphingolipid-metabolizing enzyme genes. Here, we found that yeast cells lacking RVS167 or RVS161 exhibit a decrease in sphingolipid levels. In rvs167∆ cells, the expression level of Orm2, a negative regulator of serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) catalyzing the initial step of sphingolipid biosynthesis, was increased in a calcineurin-dependent manner, and the decrease in sphingolipid levels in rvs167∆ cells was reversed on deletion of ORM2. Moreover, repression of both ORM1 and ORM2 expression or overexpression of SPT caused a strong growth defect of rvs167∆ cells, indicating that enhancement of de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis is detrimental to rvs167∆ cells. In contrast, partial repression of LCB1-encoding SPT suppressed abnormal phenotypes caused by the deletion of RVS167, including supersensitivity to high temperature and salt stress, and impairment of endocytosis and actin cytoskeleton organization. In addition, the partial repression of SPT activity suppressed the temperature supersensitivity and abnormal vacuolar morphology caused by deletion of VPS1 encoding a dynamin-like GTPase, which is required for vesicle scission and is functionally closely related to Rvs167/Rvs161, whereas repression of both ORM1 and ORM2 expression in vps1∆ cells caused a growth defect. Thus, it was suggested that proper regulation of SPT activity is indispensable for amphiphysin-deficient cells.},

abstract = {The Arp2/3 complex is essential for actin assembly and motility in many cell processes, and a large number of proteins have been found to bind and regulate it in vitro. A critical challenge is to understand the actions of these proteins in cells, especially in settings where multiple regulators are present. In a systematic study of the sequential multicomponent actin assembly processes that accompany endocytosis in yeast, we examined and compared the roles of WASp, two type-I myosins, and two other Arp2/3 activators, along with that of coronin, which is a proposed inhibitor of Arp2/3. Quantitative analysis of high-speed fluorescence imaging revealed individual functions for the regulators, manifested in part by novel phenotypes. We conclude that Arp2/3 regulators have distinct and overlapping roles in the processes of actin assembly that drive endocytosis in yeast. The formation of the endocytic actin patch, the creation of the endocytic vesicle, and the movement of the vesicle into the cytoplasm display distinct dependencies on different Arp2/3 regulators. Knowledge of these roles provides insight into the in vivo relevance of the dendritic nucleation model for actin assembly.},

abstract = {Experiments were carried out to determine the origin of cortical polarity in mouse eggs and its possible relation to the meiotic apparatus. Cortices of mature eggs overlying the meiotic apparatus (microvillus-free area) were distinguished by an absence of microvilli and a thickened layer of actin. In contrast, the surfaces of immature oocytes were covered entirely with a dense population of microvilli and were subtended by a uniform layer of actin. When induced to undergo maturation, meiotic spindles formed in the center of immature oocytes and then moved peripherally. Coincident with the cortical localization of the meiotic spindle was the formation of a microvillus-free area, i.e., a loss of microvilli and a thickening of the actin layer associated with this region of the egg cortex. If immature oocytes were incubated in cytochalasin B, meiotic spindles formed; however, they failed to move peripherally and microvillus-free areas did not develop. Oocytes incubated in colchicine did not form meiotic spindles, although the chromosomes condensed and became localized to cortices where microvillus-free areas developed. Cytochalasin B-treated mature eggs maintained intact meiotic spindles and exhibited a disappearance of microvillus-free areas and a reduction in cortical actin. The chromosomes of mature eggs treated with colchicine remained associated with microvillus-free areas despite the disappearance of meiotic spindles. Occasionally, colchicine-treated eggs possessed more than one cortically located mass of chromosomes, each of which was associated with a microvillus-free area. These observations indicate that mechanisms involving the movement of the meiotic spindle to the oocyte cortex and development and maintenance of cortical polarity are cytochalasin B sensitive. Commensurate with the localization of meiotic chromosomes to the egg cortex is the reorganization of cortical actin and the formation of a microvillus-free area.},

abstract = {Acommon focus among molecular and cellular biologists is the identification of proteins that interact with each other. Yeast two-hybrid, cDNA expression library screening, and coimmunoprecipitation experiments are powerful methods for identifying novel proteins that bind to one's favorite protein for the purpose of learning more regarding its cellular function. These same techniques, coupled with truncation and mutagenesis experiments, have been used to define the region of interaction between pairs of proteins. One conclusion from this work is that many interactions occur over short regions, often less than 10 amino acids in length within one protein. For example, mapping studies and 3-dimensional analyses of antigen-antibody interactions have revealed that epitopes are typically 4-7 residues long (1). Other examples include protein-interaction modules, such as Src homology (SH) 2 and 3 domains, phosphotyrosine binding domains (PTB), postsynaptic density/disc-large/ZO1 (PDZ) domains, WW domains, Eps15 homology (EH) domains, and 14-3-3 proteins that typically recognize linear regions of 3-9 amino acids. Each of these domains has been the subject of recent reviews published elsewhere (2 3 4 5 6 7). Among the primary structures of many ligands for protein-protein interactions, the amino acid proline is critical. In particular, SH3, WW, and several new protein-interaction domains prefer ligand sequences that are proline-rich. In addition, even though ligands for EH domains and 14-3-3 domains are not proline-rich, they do include a single proline residue. This review highlights the analysis of those protein-protein interactions that involve proline residues, the biochemistry of proline, and current drug discovery efforts based on proline peptidomimetics.-Kay, B.

abstract = {Summary 
Spatial and functional organization of cells in tissues is determined by cell-cell adhesion, thought to be initiated through trans-interactions between extracellular domains of the cadherin family of adhesion proteins, and strengthened by linkage to the actin cytoskeleton. Prevailing dogma is that cadherins are linked to the actin cytoskeleton through $\beta$-catenin and $\alpha$-catenin, although the quaternary complex has never been demonstrated. We test this hypothesis and find that $\alpha$-catenin does not interact with actin filaments and the E-cadherin-$\beta$-catenin complex simultaneously, even in the presence of the actin binding proteins vinculin and $\alpha$-actinin, either in solution or on isolated cadherin-containing membranes. Direct analysis in polarized cells shows that mobilities of E-cadherin, $\beta$-catenin, and $\alpha$-catenin are similar, regardless of the dynamic state of actin assembly, whereas actin and several actin binding proteins have higher mobilities. These results suggest that the linkage between the cadherin-catenin complex and actin filaments is more dynamic than previously appreciated.},

abstract = {Nucleation promoting factors (NPFs) initiate branched actin network assembly by activating Arp2/3 complex, a branched actin filament nucleator. Cellular actin networks contain multiple NPFs, but how they coordinately regulate Arp2/3 complex is unclear. Cortactin is an NPF that activates Arp2/3 complex weakly on its own, but with WASP/N-WASP, another class of NPFs, potently activates. We dissect the mechanism of synergy and propose a model in which cortactin displaces N-WASP from nascent branches as a prerequisite for nucleation. Single-molecule imaging revealed that unlike WASP/N-WASP, cortactin remains bound to junctions during nucleation, and specifically targets junctions with a ∼160-fold increased on rate over filament sides. N-WASP must be dimerized for potent synergy, and targeted mutations indicate release of dimeric N-WASP from nascent branches limits nucleation. Mathematical modeling shows cortactin-mediated displacement but not N-WASP recycling or filament recruitment models can explain synergy. Our results provide a molecular basis for coordinate Arp2/3 complex regulation. DOI:http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00884.001.},

abstract = {Actin filament assembly and turnover drive many forms of cellular motility, particularly extension of the leading edge of locomoting cells and rocketing of pathogenic microorganisms through host cell cytoplasm. De novo nucleation of actin filaments appears to be required for these movements. A complex of seven proteins called Arp2/3 complex is the best characterized cellular initiator of actin filament nucleation. Arp2/3 complex is intrinsically inactive, relying on nucleation promoting factors for activation. WASp/Scar family proteins are prominent cellular nucleation promoting factors. They bring together an actin monomer and Arp2/3 complex in solution or on the side of an existing actin filament to initiate a new filament that grows in the barbed end direction. WASp and N-WASP are intrinsically autoinhibited, and their activity is regulated by Rho-family GTPases such as Cdc42, membrane polyphosphoinositides, WIP/verprolin, and SH3 domain proteins. These interactions provide a final common pathway for many signaling inputs to regulate actin polymerization. Microorganisms either activate Arp2/3 complex directly or usurp N-WASP to initiate actin polymerization.},

Such vesicles have been seen associated with micropinocytosis. A simple and rapid procedure for the purification of coated vesicles from pig brain has been developed. The structures obtained have an external diameter of about 600 {\AA} and a remarkable network-like appearance. The most striking observation about these vesicles, reported here, is that they contain essentially just one protein species, having an apparent molecular weight on sodium dodecyl sulphate gels of about 180,000. Digestion of the coats with trypsin or Pronase shows that most of this protein is located on the external surface (i.e. facing the cytoplasm) of these structures. The lipid vesicles thus liberated appear to have an external diameter of about 350 {\AA}. An estimate of the number of protein molecules per vesicle is consistent with the coat having an icosahedral arrangement of subunits.},

The endosomal system provides mechanisms that enable signaling molecules initiated by extracellular cues to be trafficked throughout the expanse of the neuron, allowing intracellular signals to be sustained over long distances. Therefore endosomes are critical for many aspects of neuronal signaling that regulate cell survival, axonal growth and guidance, dendritic branching, and cell migration. An intriguing characteristic of neuronal signal transduction is that endosomal trafficking enables physiological responses that vary based on the subcellular location of signal initiation. In this review, we will discuss the specialized mechanisms and the functional significance of endosomal signaling in neurons, both during normal development and in disease.},

abstract = {An oocyte matures into an egg by extruding half of the chromosomes in a small polar body. This extremely asymmetric division enables the oocyte to retain sufficient storage material for the development of the embryo after fertilization. To divide asymmetrically, mammalian oocytes relocate the spindle from their center to the cortex. In all mammalian species analyzed so far, including human [1], mouse [2], cow [3], pig [4], and hamster [5], spindle relocation depends on filamentous actin (F-actin). However, even though spindle relocation is essential for fertility [6], the involved F-actin structures and the mechanism by which they relocate the spindle are unknown. Here we show in live mouse oocytes that spindle relocation requires a continuously reorganizing cytoplasmic actin network nucleated by Formin-2 (Fmn2). We found that the spindle poles were enriched in activated myosin and pulled on this network. Inhibition of myosin activation by myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) stopped pulling and spindle relocation, indicating that myosin pulling creates the force that drives spindle movement. Based on these results, we propose the first mechanistic model for asymmetric spindle positioning in mammalian oocytes and validate five of its key predictions experimentally.},

abstract = {Much progress defining the order and timing of endocytic internalization events has come as a result of real-time, live-cell fluorescence microscopy. Although the availability of numerous endocytic mutants makes yeast an especially valuable organism for functional analysis of endocytic dynamics, a serious limitation has been the lack of a fluorescent cargo for receptor-mediated endocytosis. We have now synthesized biologically active fluorescent mating-pheromone derivatives and demonstrated that receptor-mediated endocytosis in budding yeast occurs via the clathrin- and actin-mediated endocytosis pathway. We found that endocytic proteins first assemble into patches on the plasma membrane, and then alpha-factor associates with the patches. Internalization occurs next, concomitant with actin assembly at patches. Additionally, endocytic vesicles move toward early endosomes on actin cables. Early endosomes also associate with actin cables, and they actively move toward endocytic sites to capture vesicles being released from the plasma membrane. Thus, endocytic vesicle formation and capture of the newly released vesicles by early endosomes occur in a highly concerted manner, mediated by the actin cytoskeleton.},

To demonstrate its application we first duplicated the promoter of the FAR1 gene in yeast and simultaneously inserted a GFP downstream of it. This created a reporter for promoter activity while leaving the FAR1 gene fully intact. In another experiment, we used PCR duplication to increase the dosage of a gene in a discrete manner, from 1× to 2x. Using TUB4, the gene encoding for the yeast $\gamma$-tubulin, we validated that this led to corresponding increases in the levels of mRNA and protein. PCR duplication is an easy one-step procedure that can be adapted in different ways to permit rapid, disturbance-free investigation of various genomic regulatory elements without the need for ex vivo cloning.},

We show that the contractile ring of permeabilized fission yeast cells undergoes rapid contraction in an ATP- and myosin-II-dependent manner in the absence of other cytoplasmic constituents. Surprisingly, neither actin polymerization nor its disassembly is required for contraction of the contractile ring, although addition of exogenous actin-crosslinking proteins blocks ring contraction. Using contractile rings generated from fission yeast cytokinesis mutants, we show that not all proteins required for assembly of the ring are required for its contraction in vitro. Our work provides the beginnings of the definition of a minimal contraction-competent cytokinetic ring apparatus.},

ACAP1 (Arfgap with Coil coil, Ankyrin repeat, and PH domain protein 1) contains a BAR domain. Here, we show that this BAR domain can neither bind membrane nor impart curvature, but instead requires a neighboring PH (Pleckstrin Homology) domain to achieve these functions. Specific residues within the PH domain are responsible for both membrane binding and curvature generation. The BAR domain adjacent to the PH domain instead interacts with the BAR domains of neighboring ACAP1 proteins to enable clustering at the membrane. Thus, we have uncovered the molecular basis for an unexpected and unconventional collaboration between PH and BAR domains in membrane bending.},

The role of the BAR domain proteins in membrane shaping—with a focus on how their structural features are optimized for this function—is explained here., Against the odds of membrane resistance, members of the BIN/Amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain superfamily shape membranes and their activity is indispensable for a plethora of life functions. While crystal structures of different BAR dimers advanced our understanding of membrane shaping by scaffolding and hydrophobic insertion mechanisms considerably, especially life-imaging techniques and loss-of-function studies of clathrin-mediated endocytosis with its gradually increasing curvature show that the initial idea that solely BAR domain curvatures determine their functions is oversimplified. Diagonal placing, lateral lipid-binding modes, additional lipid-binding modules, tilde shapes and formation of macromolecular lattices with different modes of organisation and arrangement increase versatility. A picture emerges, in which BAR domain proteins create macromolecular platforms, that recruit and connect different binding partners and ensure the connection and coordination of the different events during the endocytic process, such as membrane invagination, coat formation, actin nucleation, vesicle size control, fission, detachment and uncoating, in time and space, and may thereby offer mechanistic explanations for how coordination, directionality and effectiveness of a complex process with several steps and key players can be achieved.},

Using multicolor real-time fluorescence microscopy and particle tracking algorithms, we define an early endocytic pathway wherein an invariant sequence of changes in cortical patch protein composition correlates with changes in patch motility. Three Arp2/3 activators each showed a distinct behavior, suggesting distinct patch-related endocytic functions. Actin polymerization occurs late in the endocytic pathway and is required both for endocytic internalization and for patch disassembly. In cells lacking the highly conserved endocytic protein Sla2p, patch motility was arrested and actin comet tails associated with endocytic patch complexes. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching of the actin comet tails revealed that endocytic complexes are nucleation sites for rapid actin polymerization. Attention is now focused on the mechanisms by which the order and timing of events in this endocytic pathway are achieved.},

However, the resolution of these studies is insufficient to unveil how the endocytic machinery actually drives membrane deformation in vivo. In this study, we use quantitative immuno-EM to introduce the temporal dimension to the ultrastructural analysis of membrane budding and define changes in the topography of the lipid bilayer coupled to the dynamics of endocytic proteins with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution. Using this approach, we frame the emergence of membrane curvature with respect to the recruitment of endocytic factors and show that constriction of the invaginations correlates with translocation of membrane-sculpting proteins. Furthermore, we show that initial bending of the plasma membrane is independent of actin and clathrin polymerization and precedes building of an actin cap branched by the Arp2/3 complex. Finally, our data indicate that constriction and additional elongation of the endocytic profiles require the mechanochemical activity of the myosins-I. Altogether, this work provides major insights into the molecular mechanisms driving membrane deformation in a cellular context.},

abstract = {Against the odds of membrane resistance, members of the BIN/Amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain superfamily shape membranes and their activity is indispensable for a plethora of life functions. While crystal structures of different BAR dimers advanced our understanding of membrane shaping by scaffolding and hydrophobic insertion mechanisms considerably, especially life‐imaging techniques and loss‐of‐function studies of clathrin‐mediated endocytosis with its gradually increasing curvature show that the initial idea that solely BAR domain curvatures determine their functions is oversimplified. Diagonal placing, lateral lipid‐binding modes, additional lipid‐binding modules, tilde shapes and formation of macromolecular lattices with different modes of organisation and arrangement increase versatility. A picture emerges, in which BAR domain proteins create macromolecular platforms, that recruit and connect different binding partners and ensure the connection and coordination of the different events during the endocytic process, such as membrane invagination, coat formation, actin nucleation, vesicle size control, fission, detachment and uncoating, in time and space, and may thereby offer mechanistic explanations for how coordination, directionality and effectiveness of a complex process with several steps and key players can be achieved.},

abstract = {Endophilin 1 is a presynaptically enriched protein which binds the GTPase dynamin and the polyphosphoinositide phosphatase synptojanin. Perturbation of endophilin function in cell-free systems and in a living synapse has implicated endophilin in endocytic vesicle budding (Ringstad, N., H. Gad, P. Low, G. Di Paolo, L. Brodin, O. Shupliakov, and P. De Camilli. 1999. Neuron. 24:143-154; Schmidt, A., M. Wolde, C. Thiele, W. Fest, H. Kratzin, A.V. Podtelejnikov, W. Witke, W.B. Huttner, and H.D. Soling. 1999.

Here, we show that purified endophilin can directly bind and evaginate lipid bilayers into narrow tubules similar in diameter to the neck of a clathrin-coated bud, providing new insight into the mechanisms through which endophilin may participate in membrane deformation and vesicle budding. This property of endophilin is independent of its putative lysophosphatydic acid acyl transferase activity, is mediated by its NH2-terminal region, and requires an amino acid stretch homologous to a corresponding region in amphiphysin, a protein previously shown to have similar effects on lipid bilayers (Takei, K., V.I. Slepnev, V. Haucke, and P. De Camilli. 1999. Nat. Cell Biol. 1:33-39). Endophilin cooligomerizes with dynamin rings on lipid tubules and inhibits dynamin's GTP-dependent vesiculating activity. Endophilin B, a protein with homology to endophilin 1, partially localizes to the Golgi complex and also deforms lipid bilayers into tubules, underscoring a potential role of endophilin family members in diverse tubulovesicular membrane-trafficking events in the cell.},

abstract = {The somatic gonad of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans contains a myoepithelial sheath, which surrounds oocytes and provides contractile forces during ovulation. Contractile apparatuses of the myoepithelial-sheath cells are non-striated and similar to those of smooth muscle. We report the identification of a specific isoform of actin depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin as an essential factor for assembly of contractile actin networks in the gonadal myoepithelial sheath. Two ADF/cofilin isoforms, UNC-60A and UNC-60B, are expressed from the unc-60 gene by alternative splicing. RNA interference of UNC-60A caused disorganization of the actin networks in the myoepithelial sheath. UNC-60B, which is known to function in the body-wall muscle, was not necessary or sufficient for actin organization in the myoepithelial sheath. However, mutant forms of UNC-60B with reduced actin-filament-severing activity rescued the UNC-60A-depletion phenotype. UNC-60A has a much weaker filament-severing activity than UNC-60B, suggesting that an ADF/cofilin with weak severing activity is optimal for assembly of actin networks in the myoepithelial sheath. By contrast, strong actin-filament-severing activity of UNC-60B was required for assembly of striated myofibrils in the body-wall muscle. Our results suggest that an optimal level of actin-filament-severing activity of ADF/cofilin is required for assembly of actin networks in the somatic gonad.},

abstract = {The ability to adapt to altered availability of free water is a fundamental property of living cells. The principles underlying osmoadaptation are well conserved. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an excellent model system with which to study the molecular biology and physiology of osmoadaptation. Upon a shift to high osmolarity, yeast cells rapidly stimulate a mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade, the high-osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway, which orchestrates part of the transcriptional response. The dynamic operation of the HOG pathway has been well studied, and similar osmosensing pathways exist in other eukaryotes. Protein kinase A, which seems to mediate a response to diverse stress conditions, is also involved in the transcriptional response program. Expression changes after a shift to high osmolarity aim at adjusting metabolism and the production of cellular protectants. Accumulation of the osmolyte glycerol, which is also controlled by altering transmembrane glycerol transport, is of central importance. Upon a shift from high to low osmolarity, yeast cells stimulate a different MAP kinase cascade, the cell integrity pathway. The transcriptional program upon hypo-osmotic shock seems to aim at adjusting cell surface properties. Rapid export of glycerol is an important event in adaptation to low osmolarity. Osmoadaptation, adjustment of cell surface properties, and the control of cell morphogenesis, growth, and proliferation are highly coordinated processes. The Skn7p response regulator may be involved in coordinating these events. An integrated understanding of osmoadaptation requires not only knowledge of the function of many uncharacterized genes but also further insight into the time line of events, their interdependence, their dynamics, and their spatial organization as well as the importance of subtle effects.},

In the context of cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix, the forces that are generated within the actin cytoskeleton and transmitted through integrin-based focal adhesions are essential for the cellular response to environmental clues, such as the spatial distribution of adhesive ligands or matrix stiffness. Whereas substantial progress has been made in identifying mechanosensitive molecules that can transduce mechanical force into biochemical signals, much less is known about the nature of cytoskeletal force generation and transmission that regulates the magnitude, duration and spatial distribution of forces imposed on these mechanosensitive complexes. By focusing on cell-matrix adhesion to flat elastic substrates, on which traction forces can be measured with high temporal and spatial resolution, we discuss our current understanding of the physical mechanisms that integrate a large range of molecular mechanotransduction events on cellular scales. Physical limits of stability emerge as one important element of the cellular response that complements the structural changes affected by regulatory systems in response to mechanical processes.},

In this study, Sla2 ANTH-GFP and Sjl2-3GFP were expressed as functional fusion proteins at endogenous levels to quantitatively explore PtdIns(4,5)P2 dynamics during endocytosis in yeast. Our results indicate that PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels increase and decline in conjunction with coat and actin assembly and disassembly, respectively. Live-cell image analysis of endocytic protein dynamics in an sjl1$\Delta$ sjl2$\Delta$ mutant, which has elevated PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels, revealed that the endocytic machinery is still able to assemble and disassemble dynamically, albeit nonproductively. The defects in the dynamic behavior of the various endocytic proteins in this double mutant suggest that PtdIns(4,5)P2 turnover is required for multiple stages during endocytic vesicle formation. Furthermore, our results indicate that PtdIns(4,5)P2 turnover may act in coordination with the Ark1/Prk1 protein kinases in stimulating disassembly of the endocytic machinery.},

abstract = {Microscopic imaging of fluorescent lipid derivatives is a powerful tool to study membrane organization and lipid trafficking but it is complicated by cellular autofluorescence background and photobleaching of the fluorophore as well as by the difficulty to selectively image membranes stacked on top of each other. Here we describe protocols that strongly alleviate such problems when pyrene-labeled lipids are being used. First, photobleaching of these lipids is virtually eliminated when oxygen is depleted from the medium by using a gentle and simple enzymatic method. Second, an image practically free of cellular autofluorescence contribution can be obtained simply by subtracting from the pyrene image the background image obtained at a slightly different excitation wavelength. This type of background subtraction more properly accounts for the typically uneven distribution of cellular background fluorescence than other, commonly used methods. Third, it is possible to selectively image the pyrene lipids in the plasma membrane by using plasma membrane-specific quencher trinitrophenyl lysophosphatidylethanolamine and image subtraction. Importantly, either the outer or the inner leaflet can be selectively imaged by labeling the cells with pyrene phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylserine, respectively. These protocols should be of considerable help when studying organization of the plasma membrane or intracellular lipid trafficking.},

We report on the 92-kDa protein's association with E-cadherin in the presence of various perturbants, its preferential dissociation from the immune complex upon exposure to mixed detergent micelles containing sodium dodecyl sulfate, and its preparative purification to homogeneity. We have additionally found that E-cadherin and its associated proteins may be easily and quantitatively extracted from both subconfluent and fully confluent cells by a variety of mild nonionic detergents made up in isotonic buffers. In contrast, such extractions at short times left most of the cytoskeletal protein fodrin in the insoluble pellet fraction.

Bzz1p coimmunoprecipitates in a complex with Las17p, Vrp1p, Myo3/5p, Bbc1p, Hsp70p, and actin. It colocalizes with cortical actin patches and with Las17p. This localization is dependent on Las17p, but not on F-actin. Bzz1p interacts physically and genetically with type I myosins. While deletion of BZZ1 shows no obvious phenotype, simultaneous deletion of the BZZ1, MYO3, and MYO5 genes is lethal. Overexpression of Bzz1p inhibits cell growth, and a bzz1Delta myo5Delta double mutant is unable to restore actin polarity after NaCl stress. Finally, Bzz1p in vitro is able to recruit a functional actin polymerization machinery through its SH3 domains. Its interactions with Las17p, Vrp1p, and the type I myosins are essential for this process. This suggests that Bzz1p could be implicated in the regulation of actin polymerization.},

One hypothesis postulates that the main features of these cells, including their ability to capture food by endocytosis and to digest it intracellularly, were developed first, and later had a key role in the adoption of endosymbionts; the other proposes that the transformation was triggered by an interaction between two typical prokaryotic cells, one of which became the host and the other the endosymbiont. Re-examination of this question in the light of cell-biological and phylogenetic data leads to the conclusion that the first model is more likely to be the correct one.},

The dynamin family consists of classical dynamins and dynamin-like proteins (DLPs). Due to structural and functional similarities DLPs are thought to carry out membrane tubulation and scission in a similar manner to dynamin. Here, we discuss the newly emerging roles for DLPs, which include vacuole fission and fusion, peroxisome maintenance, endocytosis and intracellular trafficking. Specific focus is given to the role of DLPs in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae because the diverse function of DLPs has been well characterized in this organism. Recent insights into DLPs may provide a better understanding of mammalian dynamin and its associated diseases.},

abstract = {We have constructed and tested a dominant resistance module, for selection of S. cerevisiae transformants, which entirely consists of heterologous DNA. This kanMX module contains the known kanr open reading-frame of the E. coli transposon Tn903 fused to transcriptional and translational control sequences of the TEF gene of the filamentous fungus Ashbya gossypii. This hybrid module permits efficient selection of transformants resistant against geneticin (G418). We also constructed a lacZMT reporter module in which the open reading-frame of the E. coli lacZ gene (lacking the first 9 codons) is fused at its 3' end to the S. cerevisiae ADH1 terminator. KanMX and the lacZMT module, or both modules together, were cloned in the center of a new multiple cloning sequence comprising 18 unique restriction sites flanked by Not I sites. Using the double module for constructions of in-frame substitutions of genes, only one transformation experiment is necessary to test the activity of the promotor and to search for phenotypes due to inactivation of this gene. To allow for repeated use of the G418 selection some kanMX modules are flanked by 470 bp direct repeats, promoting in vivo excision with frequencies of 10(-3)-10(-4). The 1.4 kb kanMX module was also shown to be very useful for PCR based gene disruptions. In an experiment in which a gene disruption was done with DNA molecules carrying PCR-added terminal sequences of only 35 bases homology to each target site, all twelve tested geneticin-resistant colonies carried the correctly integrated kanMX module.},

Long filaments were fragmented by shearing and allowed to recover. Stabilizing filaments with phalloidin in most experiments eliminated any contribution of subunit dissociation and association to the redistribution of lengths but did not affect the results. Two different assays, fluorescence microscopy to measure filament lengths and polymerization to measure concentration of barbed filament ends, gave the same time-course of annealing. The rate of annealing declines with time as the average filament length increases. Longer filaments also anneal slower than short filaments. The second-order annealing rate constant is inversely proportional to mean polymer length with a value of 1.1 mM−1 s−1/length in subunits. Capping protein slows but does not prevent annealing. Annealing is a highly favorable reaction with a strong influence on the length of polymers produced by spontaneous polymerization and should be considered in thinking about polymer dynamics in cells.},

When grown in sparse culture with no cell-cell contacts, fibroblasts and endothelial cells show an abrupt change in spread area that occurs at a stiffness range around 3,000 Pa. No actin stress fibers are seen in fibroblasts on soft surfaces, and the appearance of stress fibers is abrupt and complete at a stiffness range coincident with that at which they spread. Upregulation of alpha5 integrin also occurs in the same stiffness range, but exogenous expression of alpha5 integrin is not sufficient to cause cell spreading on soft surfaces. Neutrophils, in contrast, show no dependence of either resting shape or ability to spread after activation when cultured on surfaces as soft as 2 Pa compared to glass. The shape and cytoskeletal differences evident in single cells on soft compared to hard substrates are eliminated when fibroblasts or endothelial cells make cell-cell contact. These results support the hypothesis that mechanical factors impact different cell types in fundamentally different ways, and can trigger specific changes similar to those stimulated by soluble ligands.},

abstract = {Mechanical properties of fungal cells participate in the control of cell size, morphogenesis and function [-]. Tip growth can be understood by a viscoelastic model in which growth is derived by high internal turgor pressure and cell wall elasticity. To understand how these properties regulate growth in the rod-shaped fission yeast Schizosaccaromyces pombe, we measure key parameters by using femtoliter cylindrical PDMS microchambers with varying elasticity as force sensors for single cells. By buckling cells in these chambers, we determine the elastic surface modulus of the cell wall to be 20.2 ± 6.1 N.m-1. By analyzing the growth as they push against the walls of the chamber, we derive force-velocity relationships and values for internal effective turgor pressure of 0.85 ± 0.15 MPa and a growth stalling force of 11 ± 3 $\mu$N. The behavior of cells buckling under the force of their own growth provides an independent test of this model and parameters. Force generation is dependent on turgor pressure and a glycerol synthesis gene gpd1+ (glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), and is independent of actin cables. This study develops a quantitative framework for tip cell growth and characterize mechanisms of force generation that could contribute, for instance, in fungal invasion into host tissues.},

S. cerevisiae was the yeast best adapted to grow at high temperatures within the Saccharomyces genus, with the highest optimum (32.3°C) and maximum (45.4°C) growth temperatures. On the other hand, S. kudriavzevii and S. bayanus var. uvarum showed the lowest optimum (23.6 and 26.2°C) and maximum (36.8 and 38.4°C) growth temperatures, respectively, confirming that both species are more psychrophilic than S. cerevisiae. The remaining Saccharomyces species (S. paradoxus, S. mikatae, S. arboricolus, and S. cariocanus) showed intermediate responses. With respect to the minimum temperature which supported growth, this parameter ranged from 1.3 (S. cariocanus) to 4.3°C (S. kudriavzevii). We also tested whether these physiological traits were correlated with the phylogeny, which was accomplished by means of a statistical orthogram method. The analysis suggested that the most important shift in the adaptation to grow at higher temperatures occurred in the Saccharomyces genus after the divergence of the S. arboricolus, S. mikatae, S. cariocanus, S. paradoxus, and S. cerevisiae lineages from the S. kudriavzevii and S. bayanus var. uvarum lineages. Finally, our mathematical models suggest that temperature may also play an important role in the imposition of S. cerevisiae versus non-Saccharomyces species during wine fermentation.},

abstract = {During endocytosis, energy is invested to narrow the necks of cargo-containing plasma membrane invaginations to radii at which the opposing segments spontaneously coalesce, thereby leading to the detachment by scission of endocytic uptake carriers. In the clathrin pathway, dynamin uses mechanical energy from GTP hydrolysis to this effect, assisted by the BIN/amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain-containing protein endophilin. Clathrin-independent endocytic events are often less reliant on dynamin, and whether in these cases BAR domain proteins such as endophilin contribute to scission has remained unexplored. Here we show, in human and other mammalian cell lines, that endophilin-A2 (endoA2) specifically and functionally associates with very early uptake structures that are induced by the bacterial Shiga and cholera toxins, which are both clathrin-independent endocytic cargoes. In controlled in vitro systems, endoA2 reshapes membranes before scission. Furthermore, we demonstrate that endoA2, dynamin and actin contribute in parallel to the scission of Shiga-toxin-induced tubules. Our results establish a novel function of endoA2 in clathrin-independent endocytosis. They document that distinct scission factors operate in an additive manner, and predict that specificity within a given uptake process arises from defined combinations of universal modules. Our findings highlight a previously unnoticed link between membrane scaffolding by endoA2 and pulling-force-driven dynamic scission.},

Here, we investigated possible roles for candidate disassembly factors in regulation of the dynamics of the endocytic coat proteins Sla2p, Ent1p, Ent2p, Sla1p, Pan1p and End3p, each of which has mammalian homologues. Live cell imaging analysis revealed that in addition to the synaptojanin, Sjl2p, the Ark1p and Prk1p protein kinases, the putative Arf GTPase-activating protein, Gts1p and the Arf GTPase-interacting protein, Lsb5p, also arrive at endocytic sites late in the internalization pathway, consistent with roles in coat disassembly. Analysis of coat dynamics in various mutant backgrounds revealed that multiple pathways, including the ones mediated by an Arf guanosine triphosphatase and a synaptojanin, facilitate efficient disassembly of different endocytic coat proteins. In total, at least four separate processes are important for disassembly of endocytic complexes and efficient downstream trafficking of endocytic cargo.},

abstract = {During cell locomotion and endocytosis, membrane-tethered WASP proteins stimulate actin filament nucleation by the Arp2/3 complex. This process generates highly branched arrays of filaments that grow toward the membrane to which they are tethered, a conflict that seemingly would restrict filament growth. Using three-color single-molecule imaging in vitro we revealed how the dynamic associations of Arp2/3 complex with mother filament and WASP are temporally coordinated with initiation of daughter filament growth. We found that WASP proteins dissociated from filament-bound Arp2/3 complex prior to new filament growth. Further, mutations that accelerated release of WASP from filament-bound Arp2/3 complex proportionally accelerated branch formation. These data suggest that while WASP promotes formation of pre-nucleation complexes, filament growth cannot occur until it is triggered by WASP release. This provides a mechanism by which membrane-bound WASP proteins can stimulate network growth without restraining it. DOI:http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01008.001.},

abstract = {This paper describes a technique for growing filamentous cells of Escherichia coli with defined shapes, including crescents, zigzags, sinusoids, and spirals. The procedure begins with the fabrication of embossed microchambers in agarose. Cells are trapped in the chambers by placing a flat, flexible "ceiling", either a slab of agarose or poly(dimethylsiloxane), against an agarose mold on which a suspension of cells has been added; the use of agarose keeps cells hydrated and allows nutrients to diffuse into the chambers. Cells grown in microchambers in the presence of cephalexin grow into a multinucleate, nonseptate, filamentous phenotype and adopt the shape of the microchambers. The resulting cells are motile and can be released by removing the "ceiling" from the agarose microchambers and rinsing the cells into solution.},

abstract = {Mutations in RVS161 and RVS167 yeast genes induce identical phenotypes associated to actin cytoskeleton disorders. The whole Rvs161 protein is similar to the amino-terminal part of Rvs167p, thus defining a RVS domain. In addition to this domain, Rvs167p contains a central glycine-proline-alanine rich domain and a SH3 domain. To assess the function of these different domains we have expressed recombinant Rvs proteins in rvs mutant strains. Phenotype analysis has shown that the RVS and SH3 domains are necessary for phenotypical complementation, whereas the GPA domain is not. Moreover, we have demonstrated that the RVS domains from Rvs161p and Rvs167p have distinct roles, and that the SH3 domain needs the specific RVS domain of Rvs167p to function. These results suggest that Rvs161p and Rvs167p play distinct roles, while acting together in a common function.},

Individual muscle fibers were dissected from biopsy samples pre-BR (n=143) and post-BR (n=144). They were studied as regards cross-sectional area (CSA), myosin content by quantitative electrophoresis and myosin actin (M/A) ratio by densitometry of myosin and actin bands of individual muscle fibers. All fibers were typed according to their MHC isoform content determined by SDS-PAGE. A decrease in MHC-1 relative content and an increase in MHC-2X content of whole muscle samples were found, suggesting a slow to fast shift in muscle phenotype. Consistently, fiber type distribution was shifted toward type 2X and 2AX fibers. Muscle fiber atrophy occurred at variable extent among fiber types. Myosin concentration was significantly lower in type 1 and type 2A muscle fibers post-BR than pre-BR, whereas M/A ratio did not vary. The latter findings indicate a disproportionate loss of myosin compared with fiber CSA and a proportional loss of myosin and actin.},

abstract = {In epithelial cell lines, apical but not basolateral clathrin-mediated endocytosis has been shown to be affected by actin-disrupting drugs. Using electron and fluorescence microscopy, as well as biochemical assays, we show that the amount of actin dedicated to endocytosis is limiting at the apical surface of epithelia. In part, this contributes to the low basal rate of clathrin-dependent endocytosis observed at this epithelial surface. ARF6 in its GTP-bound state triggers the recruitment of actin from the cell cortex to the clathrin-coated pit to enable dynamin-dependent endocytosis. In addition, we show that perturbation of the apical endocytic system by expression of a clathrin heavy-chain mutant results in the collapse of microvilli. This phenotype was completely reversed by the expression of an ARF6-GTP-locked mutant. These observations indicate that concomitant to actin recruitment, the apical clathrin endocytic system is deeply involved in the morphology of the apical plasma membrane.},

abstract = {BAR (Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs) domains and amphipathic $\alpha$-helices (AHs) are believed to be sensors of membrane curvature thus facilitating the assembly of protein complexes on curved membranes. Here, we used quantitative fluorescence microscopy to compare the binding of both motifs on single nanosized liposomes of different diameters and therefore membrane curvature. Characterization of members of the three BAR domain families showed surprisingly that the crescent-shaped BAR dimer with its positively charged concave face is not able to sense membrane curvature. Mutagenesis on BAR domains showed that membrane curvature sensing critically depends on the N-terminal AH and furthermore that BAR domains sense membrane curvature through hydrophobic insertion in lipid packing defects and not through electrostatics. Consequently, amphipathic motifs, such as AHs, that are often associated with BAR domains emerge as an important means for a protein to sense membrane curvature. Measurements on single liposomes allowed us to document heterogeneous binding behaviour within the ensemble and quantify the influence of liposome polydispersity on bulk membrane curvature sensing experiments. The latter results suggest that bulk liposome-binding experiments should be interpreted with great caution.},

abstract = {The Bin1/amphiphysin/Rvs167 (BAR) domain proteins are a ubiquitous protein family. Genes encoding members of this family have not yet been found in the genomes of prokaryotes, but within eukaryotes, BAR domain proteins are found universally from unicellular eukaryotes such as yeast through to plants, insects, and vertebrates. BAR domain proteins share an N-terminal BAR domain with a high propensity to adopt $\alpha$-helical structure and engage in coiled-coil interactions with other proteins. BAR domain proteins are implicated in processes as fundamental and diverse as fission of synaptic vesicles, cell polarity, endocytosis, regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, transcriptional repression, cell-cell fusion, signal transduction, apoptosis, secretory vesicle fusion, excitation-contraction coupling, learning and memory, tissue differentiation, ion flux across membranes, and tumor suppression. What has been lacking is a molecular understanding of the role of the BAR domain protein in each process. The three-dimensional structure of the BAR domain has now been determined and valuable insight has been gained in understanding the interactions of BAR domains with membranes. The cellular roles of BAR domain proteins, characterized over the past decade in cells as distinct as yeasts, neurons, and myocytes, can now be understood in terms of a fundamental molecular function of all BAR domain proteins: to sense membrane curvature, to bind GTPases, and to mold a diversity of cellular membranes.},

We report a new approach for target identification and protein discovery based on functional suppression of chemical inhibition in vitro. We discovered pirl1, an inhibitor of actin assembly, in a screen conducted with cytoplasmic extracts. Pirl1 was used to partially inhibit actin assembly in the same assay and concentrated biochemical fractions of cytoplasmic extracts were added to find activities that suppressed pirl1 inhibition. Two activities were detected, separately purified, and identified as Arp2/3 complex and Cdc42/RhoGDI complex, both known regulators of actin assembly. We show that pirl1 directly inhibits activation of Cdc42/RhoGDI but that Arp2/3 complex represents a downstream suppressor. This work introduces a general method for using low micromolar chemical inhibitors to identify both inhibitor targets and other components of a signaling pathway.},

@article{Sorre2012,
abstract = {Cells are populated by a vast array of membrane-binding proteins that execute critical functions. Functions, like signaling and intracellular transport, require the abilities to bind to highly curved membranes and to trigger membrane deformation. Among these proteins is amphiphysin 1, implicated in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. It contains a Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs membrane-binding domain with an N-terminal amphipathic helix that senses and generates membrane curvature. However, an understanding of the parameters distinguishing these two functions is missing. By pulling a highly curved nanotube of controlled radius from a giant vesicle in a solution containing amphiphysin, we observed that the action of the protein depends directly on its density on the membrane. At low densities of protein on the nearly flat vesicle, the distribution of proteins and the mechanical effects induced are described by a model based on spontaneous curvature induction. The tube radius and force are modified by protein binding but still depend on membrane tension. In the dilute limit, when practically no proteins were present on the vesicle, no mechanical effects were detected, but strong protein enrichment proportional to curvature was seen on the tube. At high densities, the radius is independent of tension and vesicle protein density, resulting from the formation of a scaffold around the tube. As a consequence, the scaling of the force with tension is modified. For the entire density range, protein was enriched on the tube as compared to the vesicle. Our approach shows that the strength of curvature sensing and mechanical effects on the tube depends on the protein density.},

abstract = {Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells select bud  sites according to one of two predetermined patterns.  MATa and MAT$\alpha$ cells bud in an axial pattern, and  MATa/$\alpha$ cells bud in a bipolar pattern. These budding  patterns are thought to depend on the placement of  spatial cues at specific sites in the cell cortex. Because  cytoskeletal elements play a role in organizing the cytoplasm and establishing distinct plasma membrane domains, they are well suited for positioning bud-site selection cues. Indeed, the septin-containing neck  filaments are crucial for establishing the axial budding  pattern characteristic of MATa and MAT$\alpha$ cells. In this  study, we determined the budding patterns of cells carrying mutations in the actin gene or in genes encoding  actin-associated proteins: MATa/$\alpha$ cells were defective  in the bipolar budding pattern, but MATa and MAT$\alpha$  cells still exhibit a normal axial budding pattern. We  also observed that MATa/$\alpha$ actin cytoskeleton mutant  daughter cells correctly position their first bud at the  distal pole of the cell, but mother cells position their  buds randomly. The actin cytoskeleton therefore functions in generation of the bipolar budding pattern and  is required specifically for proper selection of bud sites  in mother MATa/$\alpha$ cells. These observations and the  results of double mutant studies support the conclusion  that different rules govern bud-site selection in mother  and daughter MATa/$\alpha$ cells. A defective bipolar budding pattern did not preclude an sla2-6 mutant from undergoing pseudohyphal growth, highlighting the central  role of daughter cell bud-site selection cues in the formation of pseudohyphae. Finally, by examining the  budding patterns of mad2-1 mitotic checkpoint mutants  treated with benomyl to depolymerize their microtubules, we confirmed and extended previous evidence  indicating that microtubules do not function in axial or  bipolar bud-site selection.},

abstract = {Actin filaments constitute one of the main components of cell cytoskeleton. Assembled into bundles in filopodia or in stress fibres, they play a pivotal role in eukaryotes during cell morphogenesis, adhesion and motility. The bundle emergence has been extensively related to specific actin regulators in vivo. Such dynamic modulation was also highlighted by biochemical reconstitution of the actin-network assembly, in bulk solution or with biomimetic devices. However, the question of how geometrical boundaries, such as those encountered in cells, affect the dynamic formation of highly ordered actin structures remains poorly studied. Here we demonstrate that the nucleation geometry in itself can be the principal determinant of actin-network architecture. We developed a micropatterning method that enables the spatial control of actin nucleation sites for in vitro assays. Shape, orientation and distance between nucleation regions control filament orientation and length, filament-filament interactions and filopodium-like bundle formation. Modelling of filament growth and interactions demonstrates that basic mechanical and probabilistic laws govern actin assembly in higher-order structures.},

abstract = {SH3 domains are modules of 50-70 amino acids that promote interactions among proteins, often participating in the assembly of large dynamic complexes. These domains bind to peptide ligands, which usually contain a core Pro-X-X-Pro (PXXP) sequence. Here we identify a class of SH3 domains that bind to ubiquitin. The yeast endocytic protein Sla1, as well as the mammalian proteins CIN85 and amphiphysin, carry ubiquitin-binding SH3 domains. Ubiquitin and peptide ligands bind to the same hydrophobic groove on the SH3 domain surface, and ubiquitin and a PXXP-containing protein fragment compete for binding to SH3 domains. We conclude that a subset of SH3 domains constitutes a distinct type of ubiquitin-binding domain and that ubiquitin binding can negatively regulate interaction of SH3 domains with canonical proline-rich ligands.},

abstract = {Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is a key pathway for transporting cargo into cells via membrane vesicles; it plays an integral role in nutrient import, signal transduction, neurotransmission, and cellular entry of pathogens and drug-carrying nanoparticles. Because CME entails substantial local remodeling of the plasma membrane, the presence of membrane tension offers resistance to bending and hence, vesicle formation. Experiments show that in such high-tension conditions, actin dynamics is required to carry out CME successfully. In this study, we build on these pioneering experimental studies to provide fundamental mechanistic insights into the roles of two key endocytic proteins—namely, actin and BAR proteins—in driving vesicle formation in high membrane tension environment. Our study reveals an actin force-induced “snap-through instability” that triggers a rapid shape transition from a shallow invagination to a highly invaginated tubular structure. We show that the association of BAR proteins stabilizes vesicles and induces a milder instability. In addition, we present a rather counterintuitive role of BAR depolymerization in regulating the shape evolution of vesicles. We show that the dissociation of BAR proteins, supported by actin–BAR synergy, leads to considerable elongation and squeezing of vesicles. Going beyond the membrane geometry, we put forth a stress-based perspective for the onset of vesicle scission and predict the shapes and composition of detached vesicles. We present the snap-through transition and the high in-plane stress as possible explanations for the intriguing direct transformation of broad and shallow invaginations into detached vesicles in BAR mutant yeast cells.},

abstract = {FUS7 was previously identified by a mutation that causes a defect in cell fusion in a screen for bilateral mating defects. Here we show that FUS7 is allelic to RVS161/END6, a gene implicated in a variety of  processes including viability after starvation, endocytosis, and actin cytoskeletal organization. Two lines of evidence indicate that RVS161/END6's endocytic function is not required for cell fusion. First, several other  endocytic mutants showed no cell fusion defects. Second, we isolated five function-specific alleles of  RVS161/FUS7 that were defective for endocytosis, but  not mating, and three alleles that were defective for cell  fusion but not endocytosis. The organization of the actin cytoskeleton was normal in the cell fusion mutants,  indicating that Rvs161p's function in cell fusion is independent of actin organization. The three to fourfold induction of RVS161 by mating pheromone and the localization of Rvs161p-GFP to the cell fusion zone  suggested that Rvs161p plays a direct role in cell fusion.  The phenotypes of double mutants, the coprecipitation  of Rvs161p and Fus2p, and the fact that the stability of  Fus2p was strongly dependent on Rvs161p's mating  function lead to the conclusion that Rvs161p is required  to interact with Fus2p for efficient cell fusion.},

abstract = {Capping protein (CP), which caps the growing ends of actin filaments, accelerates actin-based motility. Recent experiments on biomimetic beads have shown that CP also enhances the rate of actin filament nucleation. Proposed explanations for these phenomena include (i) the actin funneling hypothesis (AFH), in which the presence of CP increases the free-actin concentration, and (ii) the monomer gating model, in which CP binding to actin filament barbed ends makes more monomers available for filament nucleation. To establish how CP increases the rates of filament elongation and nucleation on biomimetic beads, we perform a quantitative modeling analysis of actin polymerization, using rate equations that include actin filament nucleation, polymerization and capping, as modified by monomer depletion near the surface of the bead. With one adjustable parameter, our simulation results match previously measured time courses of polymerized actin and filament number. The results support a version of the AFH where CP increases the local actin monomer concentration at the bead surface, but leaves the global free-actin concentration nearly constant. Because the rate of filament nucleation increases with the monomer concentration, the increased local monomer concentration enhances actin filament nucleation. We derive a closed-form formula for the characteristic CP concentration where the local free-actin concentration reaches half the bulk value, and find it to be comparable to the global Arp2/3 complex concentration. We also propose an experimental protocol for distinguishing branching nucleation of filaments from spontaneous nucleation.},

abstract = {Our understanding of endocytosis has evolved remarkably in little more than a decade. This is the result not only of advances in our knowledge of its molecular and biological workings, but also of a true paradigm shift in our understanding of what really constitutes endocytosis and of its role in homeostasis. Although endocytosis was initially discovered and studied as a relatively simple process to transport molecules across the plasma membrane, it was subsequently found to be inextricably linked with almost all aspects of cellular signaling. This led to the notion that endocytosis is actually the master organizer of cellular signaling, providing the cell with understandable messages that have been resolved in space and time. In essence, endocytosis provides the communications and supply routes (the logistics) of the cell. Although this may seem revolutionary, it is still likely to be only a small part of the entire story. A wealth of new evidence is uncovering the surprisingly pervasive nature of endocytosis in essentially all aspects of cellular regulation. In addition, many newly discovered functions of endocytic proteins are not immediately interpretable within the classical view of endocytosis. A possible framework, to rationalize all this new knowledge, requires us to "upgrade" our vision of endocytosis. By combining the analysis of biochemical, biological, and evolutionary evidence, we propose herein that endocytosis constitutes one of the major enabling conditions that in the history of life permitted the development of a higher level of organization, leading to the actuation of the eukaryotic cell plan.},

abstract = {Clathrin-mediated endocytosis involves cargo selection and membrane budding into vesicles with the aid of a protein coat. Formation of invaginated pits on the plasma membrane and subsequent budding of vesicles is an energetically demanding process that involves the cooperation of clathrin with many different proteins. Here we investigate the role of the brain-enriched protein epsin 1 in this process. Epsin is targeted to areas of endocytosis by binding the membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P(2)). We show here that epsin 1 directly modifies membrane curvature on binding to PtdIns(4,5)P(2) in conjunction with clathrin polymerization. We have discovered that formation of an amphipathic alpha-helix in epsin is coupled to PtdIns(4,5)P(2) binding. Mutation of residues on the hydrophobic region of this helix abolishes the ability to curve membranes. We propose that this helix is inserted into one leaflet of the lipid bilayer, inducing curvature. On lipid monolayers epsin alone is sufficient to facilitate the formation of clathrin-coated invaginations.},

abstract = {Actin filament assembly and turnover drive many forms of cellular motility, particularly extension of the leading edge of locomoting cells and rocketing of pathogenic microorganisms through host cell cytoplasm. De novo nucleation of actin filaments appears to be required for these movements. A complex of seven proteins called Arp2/3 complex is the best characterized cellular initiator of actin filament nucleation. Arp2/3 complex is intrinsically inactive, relying on nucleation promoting factors for activation. WASp/Scar family proteins are prominent cellular nucleation promoting factors. They bring together an actin monomer and Arp2/3 complex in solution or on the side of an existing actin filament to initiate a new filament that grows in the barbed end direction. WASp and N-WASP are intrinsically autoinhibited, and their activity is regulated by Rho-family GTPases such as Cdc42, membrane polyphosphoinositides, WIP/verprolin, and SH3 domain proteins. These interactions provide a final common pathway for many signaling inputs to regulate actin polymerization. Microorganisms either activate Arp2/3 complex directly or usurp N-WASP to initiate actin polymerization.},

abstract = {In order to study the ultrastructure of the cell surface and plasma membrane of Schizosaccharomyces pombe as a function of growth conditions we investigated exponential and stationary phase cells grown in rich and minimal medium. Electron microscopic preparation techniques based on rapid cryofixation (without cryoprotectants) were used. The intramembraneous aspects of the plasma membrane were described by freeze fracturing. For the first time the dynamic surface structures could be directly analyzed by freeze drying in the scanning electron microscope and in thin section of freeze substituted samples. This preparation techniques reveal hair-like structures on the surface of yeast cells. The hairs of cells grown in the rich medium are longer than those grown in the minimal medium. A mutant defective in the structure of a cell surface galactomannoprotein (acid phosphatase) reveals (under conditions of maximal acid phosphatase expression) a cell surface structure that differs from the wild type. It is likely that the hairs represent the peripheral galactomannan layer or part of it. On the membrane fracture faces the number, shape, distribution and state of aggregation of the intramembraneous particles are different between membranes of growing and non-growing cells and between cells grown under different physiological conditions. In the minimal medium corresponding periodical structures on the plasmic and exoplasmic fracture faces were observed, which clearly differ between exponential and stationary phase cells. The number, length and depth of plasma membrane invaginations increase as the cells go from the exponential phase to the stationary phase. Short and flattened invaginations are filled with thin periodic structures.},

Balanced production and turnover of PI4,5P2 is important for normal organization of the actin cytoskeleton and cell viability. Previous studies have shown that multiple PI phosphatases can regulate PI4,5P2 levels. We report a new, unexpected regulatory mechanism for PI4,5P2 homeostasis, directed by nuclear–cytoplasmic shuttling of the lipid kinase. We show that Mss4 is a phosphoprotein, which contains a functional nuclear localization signal (NLS) and can shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Temperature‐conditional mss4 cells that accumulate Mss4 protein in the nucleus exhibit reduced levels of PI4,5P2, depolarization of the actin cytoskeleton and a block in Mss4 phosphorylation, suggesting an essential role for phosphorylated Mss4 at the plasma membrane. Through the isolation of gene dosage‐dependent suppressors of mss4 mutants, we identified Bcp1, a protein enriched in the nucleus, which is required for Mss4 nuclear export and is related to the mammalian BRCA2‐interacting protein BCCIP. Together, these studies suggest a new mechanism for lipid kinase regulation through regulated nuclear–cytoplasmic shuttling.},

abstract = {A simple micromechanical method has been used to directly measure the force of contraction in single mammalian phagocytes (blood granulocytes) during engulfment of large yeast pathogens. Both the time course of cell spreading over the yeast particle and increase in cell body contractile force were quantitated at three temperatures in the range of 23-35 degrees C. The surprising feature of the phagocyte response was that engulfment and cell body contraction occurred in a serial sequence: i.e., the phagocyte spread rapidly over the particle at a steady rate with no detectable cell body contraction; when spreading stopped, contraction force in the cell body then rose steadily to a plateau level that remained stationary until the next sequence of spreading and contraction. Both spreading and contraction exhibited abrupt start/stop kinetics. Also impressive, the cell contraction force stimulated by phagocytosis was quite large (approximately 10(-8) N)-two orders of magnitude larger than the force necessary to deform passive phagocytes to the same extent. If distributed uniformly over the cell cross section, the contraction force is equivalent to an average contractile stress of approximately 10(3) N/m2 (0.01 Atm). These physical measurements in situ set critical requirements for the mechanism of force generation in granulocytes, imply that a major increase in network cross-linking accompanies build-up in contractile force and that subsequent network dissolution is necessary for locomotion.},

abstract = {The accumulation and transport of solutes are hallmarks of osmoadaptation. In this study we have employed the inability of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae gpd1$\Delta$ gpd2$\Delta$ mutant both to produce glycerol and to adapt to high osmolarity to study solute transport through aquaglyceroporins and the control of osmostress-induced signaling. High levels of different polyols, including glycerol, inhibited growth of the gpd1$\Delta$ gpd2$\Delta$ mutant. This growth inhibition was suppressed by expression of the hyperactive allele Fps1-$\Delta$1 of the osmogated yeast aquaglyceroporin, Fps1. The degree of suppression correlated with the relative rate of transport of the different polyols tested. Transport studies in secretory vesicles confirmed that Fps1-$\Delta$1 transports polyols at increased rates compared with wild type Fps1. Importantly, wild type Fps1 and Fps1-$\Delta$1 showed similarly low permeability for water. The growth defect on polyols in the gpd1$\Delta$ gpd2$\Delta$ mutant was also suppressed by expression of a heterologous aquaglyceroporin, rat AQP9. We surmised that this suppression was due to polyol influx, causing the cells to passively adapt to the stress. Indeed, when aquaglyceroporin-expressing gpd1$\Delta$ gpd2$\Delta$ mutants were treated with glycerol, xylitol, or sorbitol, the osmosensing HOG pathway was activated, and the period of activation correlated with the apparent rate of polyol uptake. This observation supports the notion that deactivation of the HOG pathway is closely coupled to osmotic adaptation. Taken together, our “conditional” osmotic stress system facilitates studies on aquaglyceroporin function and reveals features of the osmosensing and signaling system.},

Half a century of studies have uncovered tremendous insights into how a clathrin-coated vesicle is formed. More recently, the advent of live-cell imaging has provided a dynamic view of this process. As CME is highly conserved from yeast to humans, budding yeast provides an evolutionary template for this process and has been a valuable system for dissecting the underlying molecular mechanisms. In this review we trace the formation of a clathrin-coated vesicle from initiation to uncoating, focusing on key findings from the yeast system.},

@article{Wideman2014,
abstract = {Evolutionary cell biology can afford an interdisciplinary comparative view that gives insights into both the functioning of modern cells and the origins of cellular systems, including the endocytic organelles. Here, we explore several recent evolutionary cell biology studies, highlighting investigations into the origin and diversity of endocytic systems in eukaryotes. Beginning with a brief overview of the eukaryote tree of life, we show how understanding the endocytic machinery in a select, but diverse, array of organisms provides insights into endocytic system origins and predicts the likely configuration in the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA). Next, we consider three examples in which a comparative approach yielded insight into the function of modern cellular systems. First, using ESCRT-0 as an example, we show how comparative cell biology can discover both lineage-specific novelties (ESCRT-0) as well as previously ignored ancient proteins (Tom1), likely of both evolutionary and functional importance. Second, we highlight the power of comparative cell biology for discovery of previously ignored but potentially ancient complexes (AP5). Finally, using examples from ciliates and trypanosomes, we show that not all organisms possess canonical endocytic pathways, but instead likely evolved lineage-specific mechanisms. Drawing from these case studies, we conclude that a comparative approach is a powerful strategy for advancing knowledge about the general mechanisms and functions of endocytic systems.},

@article{Wertman1992,
abstract = {We report the isolation and characterization of a synoptic set of site-directed mutations distributed throughout the single actin gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Mutations were systematically targeted to the surface of the protein by identifying clusters of 2 or more charged residues in the primary sequence; every charged residue in a cluster was replaced with alanine. Mutations were recovered in high yield (34 of 36 constructed) as heterozygous diploids. Mutant phenotypes were examined in haploid segregants: 11 were recessive lethal, 16 conditional-lethal (including temperature-sensitive and salt-sensitive) and 7 had no discernible phenotype. Genetic analysis suggested that the two mutations constructed but not recovered in yeast may have a dominant defective phenotype. Location of the mutant residues on the three-dimensional structure of the rabbit muscle actin monomer confirmed that most (81{\%}) of the charged residues we altered lie at or near the surface of the protein, confirming a key assumption of the method. Many of the new act1 alleles have properties readily interpreted in light of the actin structure and should prove useful in both genetic and biochemical studies of actin function.},

abstract = {Actin filament assembly and turnover drive many forms of cellular motility, particularly extension of the leading edge of locomoting cells and rocketing of pathogenic microorganisms through host cell cytoplasm. De novo nucleation of actin filaments appears to be required for these movements. A complex of seven proteins called Arp2/3 complex is the best characterized cellular initiator of actin filament nucleation. Arp2/3 complex is intrinsically inactive, relying on nucleation promoting factors for activation. WASp/Scar family proteins are prominent cellular nucleation promoting factors. They bring together an actin monomer and Arp2/3 complex in solution or on the side of an existing actin filament to initiate a new filament that grows in the barbed end direction. WASp and N-WASP are intrinsically autoinhibited, and their activity is regulated by Rho-family GTPases such as Cdc42, membrane polyphosphoinositides, WIP/verprolin, and SH3 domain proteins. These interactions provide a final common pathway for many signaling inputs to regulate actin polymerization. Microorganisms either activate Arp2/3 complex directly or usurp N-WASP to initiate actin polymerization.},

The cytoskeletal alteration has no apparent effect on invertase secretion and polarized growth. Mutations in RTVS161, just as in RI/S167, lead to a random budding pattern in a/$\alpha$ diploid cells. This behavior is not observed in a/a diploid cells homozygous for the rvs161-1 or rvs167-1 mutations. In addition, sequence comparisons revealed that amphiphysin, a protein first found in synaptic vesicles of chicken and shown to be the autoantigen of Stiff Man syndrome, presents similarity with both Rvs proteins. Furthermore, limited similarities with myosin heavy chain and tropomyosin alpha chain from higher eukaryotic cells allow for the definition of a possible consensus sequence. The finding of related sequences suggests the existence of a function for these proteins that is conserved among eukaryotic organisms.},

@article{Lila1997a,
abstract = {In a variety of organisms, a number of proteins associated with the cortical actin cytoskeleton contain SH3 domains, suggesting that these domains may provide the physical basis for functional interactions among structural and regulatory proteins in the actin cytoskeleton. We present evidence that SH3 domains mediate at least two independent functions of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae actin-binding protein Abp1p in vivo. Abp1p contains a single SH3 domain that has recently been shown to bind in vitro to the adenylyl cyclase-associated protein Srv2p. Immunofluorescence analysis of Srv2p subcellular localization in strains carrying mutations in either ABP1 or SRV2 reveals that the Abp1p SH3 domain mediates the normal association of Srv2p with the cortical actin cytoskeleton. We also show that a site in Abp1p itself is specifically bound by the SH3 domain of the actin-associated protein Rvs167p. Genetic analysis provides evidence that Abp1p and Rvs167p have functions that are closely interrelated. Abp1 null mutations, like rvs167 mutations, result in defects in sporulation and reduced viability under certain suboptimal growth conditions. In addition, mutations in ABP1 and RVS167 yield similar profiles of genetic "synthetic lethal" interactions when combined with mutations in genes encoding other cytoskeletal components. Mutations which specifically disrupt the SH3 domain-mediated interaction between Abp1p and Srv2p, however, show none of the shared phenotypes of abp1 and rvs167 mutations. We conclude that the Abp1p SH3 domain mediates the association of Srv2p with the cortical actin cytoskeleton, and that Abp1p performs a distinct function that is likely to involve binding by the Rvs167p SH3 domain. Overall, work presented here illustrates how SH3 domains can integrate the activities of multiple actin cytoskeleton proteins in response to varying environmental conditions.},

@article{Demming2013,
abstract = {The merits of nanostructures in sensing may seem obvious, yet playing these attributes to their maximum advantage can be a work of genius. As fast as sensing technology is improving, expectations are growing, with demands for cheaper devices with higher sensitivities and an ever increasing range of functionalities and compatibilities. At the same time tough scientific challenges like low power operation, noise and low selectivity are keeping researchers busy. This special issue on sensing at the nanoscale with guest editor Christofer Hierold from ETH Zurich features some of the latest developments in sensing research pushing at the limits of current capabilities. Cheap and easy fabrication is a top priority. Among the most popular nanomaterials in sensing are ZnO nanowires and in this issue Dario Zappa and colleagues at Brescia University in Italy simplify an already cheap and efficient synthesis method, demonstrating ZnO nanowire fabrication directly onto silicon substrates [1]. Meanwhile Nicolae Barson and colleagues in Germany point out the advantages of flame spray pyrolysis fabrication in a topical review [2] and, maximizing on existing resources, researchers in Denmark and Taiwan report cantilever sensing using a US{\$}20 commercial DVD-ROM optical pickup unit as the readout source [3]. The sensor is designed to detect physiological concentrations of soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor, a protein associated with inflammation due to HIV, cancer and other infectious diseases. With their extreme properties carbon nanostructures feature prominently in the issue, including the demonstration of a versatile and flexible carbon nanotube strain sensor [4] and a graphene charge sensor with sensitivities of the order of 1.3 × 10(-3) e Hz(-1/2) [5]. The issue of patterning for sensing devices is also tackled by researchers in the US who demonstrate a novel approach for multicomponent pattering metal/metal oxide nanoparticles on graphene [6]. Changes in electrical properties are an important indicator for sensing. In search of a better understanding of these systems Zhang et al from Southern Illinois University inspect the role of Joule heating, exothermal reactions and heat dissipation in gas sensing using nanowires [7]. The mechanisms behind electrical chemical sensors are also further scrutinized in a kinetics study by Joan Ramon Morante from the University of Barcelona in Spain. 'In spite of the growing commercial success many basic issues remain still open and under discussion limiting the broad use of this technology,' he explains. He discusses surface chemical reaction kinetics and the experimental results for different representative gas molecules to gain an insight into the chemical to electrical transduction mechanisms taking place [8]. Perhaps one of the most persistent targets in sensing research is increasing the sensitivity. Gauging environmental health issues around the commercial use of nanomaterials places high demands on low-level detection and spurred a collaboration of researchers in the UK, Croatia and Canada to look into the use of particle-impact voltammetry for detecting nanoparticles in environmental media [9]. At the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in the US, researchers have applied wave transform analysis techniques to the oscillations of an atomic force microscopy cantilever and tailored a time-frequency-domain filter to identify the region of highest vibrational energy [10]. The approach allows them to improve the signal to noise ratio by a factor 32 on current high-performance devices. In addition, researchers in Korea report how doping NiO nanofibres can improve the sensitivity to a number of gases, including ethanol, where the response was enhanced by as much as a factor of 217.86 [11]. Biomedicine is one of the largest industries for the application of nanotechnology in sensing. Demonstrating the state of the art, researchers in China use silicon wafers decorated with gold nanoparticles for label-free detection of DNA at concentrations as low as 1-10 fM, a sensitivity comparable to the best signal amplification-assisted electrochemical sensors reported [12]. In another study actin-conjugated gold and silver nanorods are used to detect ATP, a common indicator of cell viability [13]. They show how aggregation induced by ATP-induced polymerization of the G-actin gives rise to a measurable change in the plasmon resonance absorbance of the nanorods. A review of the use of fluorescent silica nanoparticles for biomedical applications is provided by researchers at Dublin City University in Ireland [14]. The first scanning tunnelling microscope in the early 1980s and subsequent scanning probe developments brought the world of nanoscale structures into view in a manner that gorged the imaginations of scientists and the public. New ways of probing structures at this scale revealed a wealth of curious properties that triggered a surge of research activity in nanotechnology, now a multibillion dollar industry. One good turn deserves another and in fact nanostructures provide the perfect tools for the type of sensing and imaging applications that brought such widespread research interest to nanotechnology. This special issue highlights just how broad and innovative the range of sensing nanotechnologies has grown.

abstract = {In this report, we have shown that the yeast amphiphysin-like protein Rvs167p was localized mainly in small cortical patches throughout the cell in unbudding cells. During budding, the patches were polarized at bud emergence site. During mating, Rvs167p was concentrated at the tip of the shmoo. Rvs167p colocalized with actin patches during yeast vegetative growth and mating. Complete disruption of the actin cytoskeleton using Latrunculin-A did not affect Rvs167p localization in patches throughout the cell. In rvs167 mutant cells, actin patches are mislocalized and in rvs161 or abp1 mutant cells, Rvs167p localization is not affected. These observations suggest that Rvs167p may localize the actin cortical complex properly. Finally, the amphiphysin-conserved N-terminal domain of Rvs167p, called the BAR domain, was required but not sufficient for the correct localization of the protein.},

Half a century of studies have uncovered tremendous insights into how a clathrin-coated vesicle is formed. More recently, the advent of live-cell imaging has provided a dynamic view of this process. As CME is highly conserved from yeast to humans, budding yeast provides an evolutionary template for this process and has been a valuable system for dissecting the underlying molecular mechanisms. In this review we trace the formation of a clathrin-coated vesicle from initiation to uncoating, focusing on key findings from the yeast system.},

abstract = {Summary
Endocytosis, like many dynamic cellular processes, requires precise temporal and spatial orchestration of complex protein machinery to mediate membrane budding. To understand how this machinery works, we directly correlated fluorescence microscopy of key protein pairs with electron tomography. We systematically located 211 endocytic intermediates, assigned each to a specific time window in endocytosis, and reconstructed their ultrastructure in 3D. The resulting virtual ultrastructural movie defines the protein-mediated membrane shape changes during endocytosis in budding yeast. It reveals that clathrin is recruited to flat membranes and does not initiate curvature. Instead, membrane invagination begins upon actin network assembly followed by amphiphysin binding to parallel membrane segments, which promotes elongation of the invagination into a tubule. Scission occurs on average 9 s after initial bending when invaginations are ∼100 nm deep, releasing nonspherical vesicles with 6,400 nm2 mean surface area. Direct correlation of protein dynamics with ultrastructure provides a quantitative 4D resource.},

abstract = {Mucosal tissues undergo contraction and relaxation on a continuous basis. In its normal state, the pliable intestinal tract is characterized by a rhythmic pattern of contractions controlled by its intrinsic neuronal innvervation. In chronic inflammatory diseases such as Crohn's disease, the intestine can become stiff and fibrotic, losing much of its normal motility. Although muscle fiber contraction accounts for much of this activity, contraction of nonmuscle tissue is constantly occurring in events associated with chronic inflammation, such as wound healing, scar formation, and tissue remodeling. However, the physiological and pathological mechanisms defining these events are not well defined. Tissue contraction is a dynamic event characterized by both intracellular and extracellular events. A number of cells, such as fibroblasts, epithelial cells, lymphocytes, and eosinophils, normally reside within the gastrointestinal tract. Additionally, the extracellular matrix is composed of a complex infrastructure that includes collagen and other molecules. The manner in which these two components interact is not certain, but the use of recent model systems has provided insights into these processes. The collagen lattice contraction assay provides a model for tissue contraction that takes advantage of the finding that cell-populated collagen hydrogels contract over time in a predictable, consistent manner. This model allows for investigation of the influence of specific agonists on the rate and extent of matrix contraction.},

However, here we report that the membrane-sculpting F-BAR domain–containing Fer/Cip4 homology domain-only proteins 1 and 2 (FCHo1/2) were required for plasma membrane clathrin-coated vesicle (CCV) budding and marked sites of CCV formation. Changes in FCHo1/2 expression levels correlated directly with numbers of CCV budding events, ligand endocytosis, and synaptic vesicle marker recycling. FCHo1/2 proteins bound specifically to the plasma membrane and recruited the scaffold proteins eps15 and intersectin, which in turn engaged the adaptor complex AP2. The FCHo F-BAR membrane-bending activity was required, leading to the proposal that FCHo1/2 sculpt the initial bud site and recruit the clathrin machinery for CCV formation.},

abstract = {To test the hypothesis that the myosin II motor domain (S1) preferentially binds to specific subsets of actin filaments in vivo, we expressed GFP-fused S1 with mutations that enhanced its affinity for actin in Dictyostelium cells. Consistent with the hypothesis, the GFP-S1 mutants were localized along specific portions of the cell cortex. Comparison with rhodamine-phalloidin staining in fixed cells demonstrated that the GFP-S1 probes preferentially bound to actin filaments in the rear cortex and cleavage furrows, where actin filaments are stretched by interaction with endogenous myosin II filaments. The GFP-S1 probes were similarly enriched in the cortex stretched passively by traction forces in the absence of myosin II or by external forces using a microcapillary. The preferential binding of GFP-S1 mutants to stretched actin filaments did not depend on cortexillin I or PTEN, two proteins previously implicated in the recruitment of myosin II filaments to stretched cortex. These results suggested that it is the stretching of the actin filaments itself that increases their affinity for the myosin II motor domain. In contrast, the GFP-fused myosin I motor domain did not localize to stretched actin filaments, which suggests different preferences of the motor domains for different structures of actin filaments play a role in distinct intracellular localizations of myosin I and II. We propose a scheme in which the stretching of actin filaments, the preferential binding of myosin II filaments to stretched actin filaments, and myosin II-dependent contraction form a positive feedback loop that contributes to the stabilization of cell polarity and to the responsiveness of the cells to external mechanical stimuli.},

Then, it summarizes adherens junction assembly at cellularization and maturation at gastrulation. Finally, the regulation of adherens junctions during tissue morphogenesis is discussed. This discussion compares major morphogenetic events in the embryo (invagination of the ventral furrow, convergent extension of the germband, flattening of the amnioserosa, maintenance of tissue borders, epithelial branching, lumen formation, cell delamination, cell division, apoptosis, and dorsal closure) and common mechanisms involved (myosin activity, endocytosis, and mesenchymal-to-epithelial transitions).},

After treatment for 60 min at 30 degrees C, FM 4-64 stained the vacuole membrane (ring staining pattern). FM 4-64 did not appear to reach the vacuole by passive diffusion because at 0 degree C it exclusively stained the plasma membrane (PM). The PM staining decreased after warming cells to 25 degrees C and small punctate structures became apparent in the cytoplasm within 5-10 min. After an additional 20-40 min, the PM and cytoplasmic punctate staining disappeared concomitant with staining of the vacuolar membrane. Under steady state conditions, FM 4-64 staining was specific for vacuolar membranes; other membrane structures were not stained. The dye served as a sensitive reporter of vacuolar dynamics, detecting such events as segregation structure formation during mitosis, vacuole fission/fusion events, and vacuolar morphology in different classes of vacuolar protein sorting (vps) mutants. A particularly striking pattern was observed in class E mutants (e.g., vps27) where 500-700 nm organelles (presumptive prevacuolar compartments) were intensely stained with FM 4-64 while the vacuole membrane was weakly fluorescent. Internalization of FM 4-64 at 15 degrees C delayed vacuolar labeling and trapped FM 4-64 in cytoplasmic intermediates between the PM and the vacuole. The intermediate structures in the cytoplasm are likely to be endosomes as their staining was temperature, time, and energy dependent. Interestingly, unlike Lucifer yellow uptake, vacuolar labeling by FM 4-64 was not blocked in sec18, sec14, end3, and end4 mutants, but was blocked in sec1 mutant cells. Finally, using permeabilized yeast spheroplasts to reconstitute FM 4-64 transport, we found that delivery of FM 4-64 from the endosome-like intermediate compartment (labeled at 15 degrees C) to the vacuole was ATP and cytosol dependent. Thus, we show that FM 4-64 is a new vital stain for the vacuolar membrane, a marker for endocytic intermediates, and a fluor for detecting endosome to vacuole membrane transport in vitro.},

abstract = {Background
The spatiotemporal regulation of adhesion to the extracellular matrix is important in metazoan cell migration and mechanosensation. While adhesion assembly depends on intracellular and extracellular tension, the biophysical regulation of force transmission between the actin cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix during this process remains largely unknown.

Results
To elucidate the nature of force transmission as myosin-II tension is applied to focal adhesions, we correlated the dynamics of focal adhesion proteins and the actin cytoskeleton to local traction stresses. We find that, under low extracellular tension, newly formed adhesions near the cell periphery undergo a transient retrograde displacement preceding elongation. We identify that myosin-II generated tension drives this mobility and determine the interface of differential motion, or ‘slip', to be between the integrin and the ECM. We found that the magnitude and duration of both adhesion slip and associated F-actin dynamics is strongly modulated by the ECM compliance. Furthermore, traction forces are generated throughout the slip period with adhesion immobilization occurring at a constant tension.

Conclusions
We have identified a tension-dependent, extracellular ‘clutch' between integrins and the extracellular matrix that is utilized to stabilize adhesions under myosin-II driven tension. This work signifies that modulating adhesion alters force transmission during focal adhesion maturation.},

abstract = {The Saccharomyces cerevisiae synaptojanin-like proteins (Sjl1, Sjl2, and Sjl3) are phosphoinositide (PI) phosphatases that regulate PI metabolism in the control of actin organization and membrane trafficking. However, the primary sites of action for each of the yeast synaptojanin-like proteins remain unclear. In this study, we show that Sjl2 is localized to cortical actin patches, sites of endocytosis. Cortical recruitment of Sjl2 requires the actin patch component Abp1. Consistent with this, the SH3 domain-containing protein Abp1 physically associates with Sjl2 through its proline-rich domain. Furthermore, abp1$\Delta$ mutations confer defects resembling loss of SJL2; sjl1$\Delta$ abp1$\Delta$ double-mutant cells exhibit invaginated plasma membranes and impaired endocytosis, findings similar to those for sjl1$\Delta$ sjl2$\Delta$ mutant cells. Thus, Abp1 acts as an adaptor protein in the localization or concentration of Sjl2 during late stages of endocytic vesicle formation. Overexpression of the Hip1-related protein Sla2 delayed the formation of extended plasma membrane invaginations in sjl2ts cells, indicating that Sla2 may become limiting or misregulated in cells with impaired PI phosphatase activity. Consistent with this, the cortical actin patch protein Sla2 is mislocalized in sjl1$\Delta$ sjl2$\Delta$ mutant cells. Together, our studies suggest that PI metabolism by the synaptojanin-like proteins coordinately directs actin dynamics and membrane invagination, in part by regulation of Sla2.},

abstract = {We characterized the yeast actin cytoskeleton at the ultrastructural level using immunoelectron microscopy. Anti-actin antibodies primarily labeled dense, patchlike cortical structures and cytoplasmic cables. This localization recapitulates results obtained with immunofluorescence light microscopy, but at much higher resolution. Immuno-EM double-labeling experiments were conducted with antibodies to actin together with antibodies to the actin binding proteins Abp1p and cofilin. As expected from immunofluorescence experiments, Abp1p, cofilin, and actin colocalized in immuno-EM to the dense patchlike structures but not to the cables. In this way, we can unambiguously identify the patches as the cortical actin cytoskeleton. The cortical actin patches were observed to be associated with the cell surface via an invagination of plasma membrane. This novel cortical cytoskeleton-plasma membrane interface appears to consist of a fingerlike invagination of plasma membrane around which actin filaments and actin binding proteins are organized. We propose a possible role for this unique cortical structure in wall growth and osmotic regulation.},

abstract = {The ease of construction of multiple mutant strains in Schizosaccharomyces pombe is limited by the number of available genetic markers. We describe here three new cassettes for PCR-mediated gene disruption that can be used in combination with commonly used fission yeast markers to make multiple gene deletions. The natMX6, hphMX6 and bleMX6 markers give rise to resistance towards the antibiotics nourseothricin (NAT), hygromycin B and phleomycin, respectively. The cassettes are composed of exogenous sequences to increase the frequency of integration at targeted loci, and have a structure similar to the commonly used pFA6a–kanMX6 modular plasmid system. This allows a simple exchange of the kanMX6 marker in existing strains with any of the three new cassettes. Alternatively, oligonucleotide primers designed for the modular kanMX6 cassettes can be used to make the transforming PCR fragments for gene disruption. We illustrate the construction of a mutant strain with six independent gene disruptions, using the novel antibiotic cassettes in combination with existing genetic markers.

AtxA caused changes in the dynamics of vesicle formation and scission from the plasma membrane in a phospholipase activity dependent manner. Our data, based on synthetic dosage lethality screen and the analysis of the dynamics of sites of endocytosis, indicate that AtxA impairs the activity of amphiphysin.ConclusionsWe identified amphiphysin and endocytosis as the target of AtxA intracellular activity. We propose that AtxA reduces endocytosis following a mechanism of action which includes both a specific protein–protein interaction and enzymatic activity, and which is applicable to yeast and mammalian cells. Knowing how neurotoxic phospholipases A2 work can open new ways to regulate endocytosis.},

We present the GMPPCP-bound structures of the truncated human dynamin 1 helical polymer at 12.2 {\AA} and a fusion protein, GG, linking human dynamin 1's catalytic G domain to its GTPase effector domain (GED) at 2.2 {\AA}. The structures reveal the position and connectivity of dynamin fragments in the assembled structure, showing that G domain dimers only form between tetramers in sequential rungs of the dynamin helix. Using chemical crosslinking, we demonstrate that dynamin tetramers are made of two dimers, in which the G domain of one molecule interacts in trans with the GED of another. Structural comparison of GG(GMPPCP) to the GG transition-state complex identifies a hydrolysis-dependent powerstroke that may play a role in membrane-remodeling events necessary for fission.},

abstract = {During endocytic vesicle formation, distinct subdomains along the membrane invagination are specified by different proteins, which bend the membrane and drive scission. Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs (BAR) and Fer-CIP4 homology-BAR (F-BAR) proteins can induce membrane curvature and have been suggested to facilitate membrane invagination and scission. Two F-BAR proteins, Syp1 and Bzz1, are found at budding yeast endocytic sites. Syp1 arrives early but departs from the endocytic site before formation of deep membrane invaginations and scission. Using genetic, spatiotemporal, and ultrastructural analyses, we demonstrate that Bzz1, the heterodimeric BAR domain protein Rvs161/167, actin polymerization, and the lipid phosphatase Sjl2 cooperate, each through a distinct mechanism, to induce membrane scission in yeast. Additionally, actin assembly and Rvs161/167 cooperate to drive formation of deep invaginations. Finally, we find that Bzz1, acting at the invagination base, stabilizes endocytic sites and functions with Rvs161/167, localized along the tubule, to achieve proper endocytic membrane geometry necessary for efficient scission. Together, our results reveal that dynamic interplay between a lipid phosphatase, actin assembly, and membrane-sculpting proteins leads to proper membrane shaping, tubule stabilization, and scission.},

abstract = {Recent studies have suggested that the function of the large GTPase dynamin in endocytosis in mammalian cells may comprise a modulation of actin cytoskeleton. The role of dynamin in actin cytoskeleton organization in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has remained undefined. In this report, we found that one of the yeast dynamin-related proteins, Vps1p, is required for normal actin cytoskeleton organization. At both permissive and non-permissive temperatures, the vps1 mutants exhibited various degrees of phenotypes commonly associated with actin cytoskeleton defects: depolarized and aggregated actin structures, hypersensitivity to the actin cytoskeleton toxin latrunculin-A, randomized bud site selection and chitin deposition, and impaired efficiency in the internalization of membrane receptors. Over-expression of the GTPase mutants of vps1 also led to actin abnormalities. Consistent with these actin-related defects, Vps1p was found to interact physically, and partially co-localize, with the actin-regulatory protein Sla1p. The normal cellular localization of Sla1p required Vps1p and could be altered by over-expression of a region of Vps1p that was involved in the interaction with Sla1p. The same region also promoted mis-sorting of the vacuolar protein carboxypeptidase Y upon over-expression. These findings suggest that the functions of the dynamin-related protein Vps1p in actin cytoskeleton dynamics and vacuolar protein sorting are probably related to each other.},

@article{Shen1999,
abstract = {For many organisms there is a correlation between increases of metabolites and osmotic stress tolerance, but the mechanisms that cause this protection are not clear. To understand the role of polyols, genes for bacterial mannitol-1-P dehydrogenase and apple sorbitol-6-P dehydrogenase were introduced into a Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant deficient in glycerol synthesis. Sorbitol and mannitol provided some protection, but less than that generated by a similar concentration of glycerol generated by glycerol-3-P dehydrogenase (GPD1). Reduced protection by polyols suggested that glycerol had specific functions for which mannitol and sorbitol could not substitute, and that the absolute amount of the accumulating osmoticum might not be crucial. The retention of glycerol and mannitol/sorbitol, respectively, was a major difference. During salt stress, cells retained more of the six-carbon polyols than glycerol. We suggest that the loss of {\textgreater}98{\%} of the glycerol synthesized could provide a safety valve that dissipates reducing power, while a similar high intracellular concentration of retained polyols would be less protective. To understand the role of glycerol in salt tolerance, salt-tolerant suppressor mutants were isolated from the glycerol-deficient strain. One mutant, sr13, partially suppressed the salt-sensitive phenotype of the glycerol-deficient line, probably due to a doubling of [K+] accumulating during stress. We compare these results to the “osmotic adjustment” concept typically applied to accumulating metabolites in plants. The accumulation of polyols may have dual functions: facilitating osmotic adjustment and supporting redox control.
Selaginella lepidophylla is one of only a few species of spike mosses (Selaginellaceae) that have evolved desiccation tolerance (DT) or the ability to ‘resurrect' from an air-dried state. In order to understand the metabolic basis of DT, S. lepidophylla was subjected to a five-stage, rehydration/dehydration cycle, then analyzed using non-biased, global metabolomics profiling technology based on GC/MS and UHLC/MS/MS2 platforms. A total of 251 metabolites including 167 named (66.5{\%}) and 84 (33.4{\%}) unnamed compounds were characterized. Only 42 (16.7{\%}) and 74 (29.5{\%}) of compounds showed significantly increased or decreased abundance, respectively, indicating that most compounds were produced constitutively, including highly abundant trehalose, sucrose, and glucose. Several glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates showed increased abundance at 100{\%} relative water content (RWC) and 50{\%} RWC. Vanillate, a potent antioxidant, was also more abundant in the hydrated state. Many different sugar alcohols and sugar acids were more abundant in the hydrated state. These polyols likely decelerate the rate of water loss during the drying process as well as slow water absorption during rehydration, stabilize proteins, and scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS). In contrast, nitrogen-rich and $\gamma$-glutamyl amino acids, citrulline, and nucleotide catabolism products (e.g. allantoin) were more abundant in the dry states, suggesting that these compounds might play important roles in nitrogen remobilization during rehydration or in ROS scavenging. UV-protective compounds such as 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)propionate, apigenin, and naringenin, were more abundant in the dry states. Most lipids were produced constitutively, with the exception of choline phosphate, which was more abundant in dry states and likely plays a role in membrane hydration and stabilization. In contrast, several polyunsaturated fatty acids were more abundant in the hydrated states, suggesting that these compounds likely help maintain membrane fluidity during dehydration. Lastly, S. lepidophylla contained seven unnamed compounds that displayed twofold or greater abundance in dry or rehydrating states, suggesting that these compounds might play adaptive roles in DT.},

abstract = {Recent data have shown that Eps15, a newly identified component of clathrin-coated pits constitutively associated with the AP-2 complex, is required for receptor-mediated endocytosis. However, its precise function remains unknown. Interestingly, Eps15 contains three EH (Eps15-Homology) domains also found in proteins required for the internalization step of endocytosis in yeast. Results presented here show that EH domains are required for correct coated pit targeting of Eps15. Furthermore, when cells expressed an Eps15 mutant lacking EH domains, the plasma membrane punctate distribution of both AP-2 and clathrin was lost, implying the absence of coated pits. This was further confirmed by the fact that dynamin, a GTPase found in coated pits, was homogeneously redistributed on the plasma membrane and that endocytosis of transferrin, a specific marker of clathrin-dependent endocytosis, was strongly inhibited. Altogether, these results strongly suggest a role for Eps15 in coated pit assembly and more precisely a role for Eps15 in the docking of AP-2 onto the plasma membrane. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that a GFP fusion protein encoding the ear domain of (alpha)-adaptin, the AP-2 binding site for Eps15, was efficiently targeted to plasma membrane coated pits.},

abstract = {Dynamins are a conserved family of proteins involved in membrane fusion and fission. Although mammalian dynamins are known to be involved in several membrane-trafficking events, the role of dynamin-1 in endocytosis is the best-characterised role of this protein family. Despite many similarities between endocytosis in yeast and mammalian cells, a comparable role for dynamins in yeast has not previously been demonstrated. The reported lack of involvement of dynamins in yeast endocytosis has raised questions over the general applicability of the current yeast model of endocytosis, and has also precluded studies using well-developed methods in yeast, to further our understanding of the mechanism of dynamin function during endocytosis. Here, we investigate the yeast dynamin-like protein Vps1 and demonstrate a transient burst of localisation to sites of endocytosis. Using live-cell imaging of endocytic reporters in strains lacking vps1, and also electron microscopy and biochemical approaches, we demonstrate a role for Vps1 in facilitating endocytic invagination. Vps1 mutants were generated, and analysis in several assays reveals a role for the C-terminal self-assembly domain in endocytosis but not in other membrane fission events with which Vps1 has previously been associated.},

In this study we investigated the impact of microtubules and the acto-myosin machinery on the kinetics of force-induced reorientation of NIH3T3 fibroblasts. These cells were subjected to uniaxial stretching forces that are known to induce cellular reorientation perpendicular to the stretch direction. We found that disruption of filamentous actin using cytochalasin D and latrunculin B as well as an induction of a massive unpolarized actin polymerization by jasplakinolide, inhibited the stretch-induced reorientation. Similarly, blocking of myosin II activity abolished the stretch-induced reorientation of cells but, interestingly, increased their motility under stretching conditions in comparison to myosin-inhibited nonstretched cells. Investigating the contribution of microtubules to the cellular reorientation, we found that, although not playing a significant role in reorientation itself, microtubule stability had a significant impact on the kinetics of this event. Overall, we conclude that acto-myosin, together with microtubules, regulate the kinetics of force-induced cell reorientation.},

Rvs161p was required for actin repolarization because the rvs161delta mutant did not repolarize actin patches after growth in a salt medium. Mutations suppressing the rvs161delta-related salt sensitivity all occurred in genes required for sphingolipid biosynthesis: FEN1, SUR4, SUR2, SUR1, and IPT1. These suppressors also suppressed act1-1-related salt sensitivity and the defect in actin repolarization of the rvs161delta mutant, providing a link between sphingolipids and actin polarization. Indeed, deletion of the suppressor genes suppressed the rvs161delta defect in actin repolarization in two ways: either actin was not depolarized at the wild-type level in a set of suppressor mutants, or actin was repolarized in the absence of Rvs161p in the other suppressor mutants. Rvs161p was localized as cortical patches that concentrated at polarization sites, i.e., bud emergence and septa, and was found to be associated with lipid rafts. An important link between sphingolipids and actin polarization is that Rvs161p was required for actin repolarization and was found to be located in lipid rafts.},

abstract = {Back to TopAbstract
Neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein (N-WASP) transmits signals from Cdc42 to the nucleation of actin filaments by Arp2/3 complex. Although full-length N-WASP is a weak activator of Arp2/3 complex, its activity can be enhanced by upstream regulators such as Cdc42 and PI(4,5)P2. We dissected this activation reaction and found that the previously described physical interaction between the NH2-terminal domain and the COOH-terminal effector domain of N-WASP is a regulatory interaction because it can inhibit the actin nucleation activity of the effector domain by occluding the Arp2/3 binding site. This interaction between the NH2- and COOH termini must be intramolecular because in solution N-WASP is a monomer. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) influences the activity of N-WASP through a conserved basic sequence element located near the Cdc42 binding site rather than through the WASp homology domain 1. Like Cdc42, PI(4,5)P2 reduces the affinity between the NH2- and COOH termini of the molecule. The use of a mutant N-WASP molecule lacking this basic stretch allowed us to delineate a signaling pathway in Xenopus extracts leading from PI(4,5)P2 to actin nucleation through Cdc42, N-WASP, and Arp2/3 complex. In this pathway, PI(4,5)P2 serves two functions: first, as an activator of N-WASP; and second, as an indirect activator of Cdc42.},

@article{Soulard2002c,
abstract = {In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the WASP (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein) homologue Las17p (also called Bee1p) is an important component of cortical actin patches. Las17p is part of a high-molecular-weight protein complex that regulates Arp2/3 complex-dependent actin polymerization at the cell cortex and that includes the type I myosins Myo3p and Myo5p and verprolin (Vrp1p). To identify other factors implicated with this complex in actin regulation, we isolated proteins that bind to Las17p by two-hybrid screening and affinity chromatography. Here, we report the characterization of Lsb7/Bzz1p (for Las seventeen binding protein 7), an Src homology 3 (SH3) domain protein that interacts directly with Las17p via a polyproline-SH3 interaction. Bzz1p coimmunoprecipitates in a complex with Las17p, Vrp1p, Myo3/5p, Bbc1p, Hsp70p, and actin. It colocalizes with cortical actin patches and with Las17p. This localization is dependent on Las17p, but not on F-actin. Bzz1p interacts physically and genetically with type I myosins. While deletion of BZZ1 shows no obvious phenotype, simultaneous deletion of the BZZ1, MYO3, and MYO5 genes is lethal. Overexpression of Bzz1p inhibits cell growth, and a bzz1$\Delta$ myo5$\Delta$ double mutant is unable to restore actin polarity after NaCl stress. Finally, Bzz1p in vitro is able to recruit a functional actin polymerization machinery through its SH3 domains. Its interactions with Las17p, Vrp1p, and the type I myosins are essential for this process. This suggests that Bzz1p could be implicated in the regulation of actin polymerization.},

To determine the functional relationship between these proteins and dynamin, we have analyzed endocytic intermediates that accumulate in cells that lack dynamin (derived from dynamin 1 and 2 double conditional knockout mice). In these cells, actin-nucleating proteins, actin, and BAR domain proteins accumulate at the base of arrested endocytic clathrin-coated pits, where they support the growth of dynamic long tubular necks. These results, which we show reflect the sequence of events in wild-type cells, demonstrate a concerted action of these proteins prior to, and independent of, dynamin and emphasize similarities between clathrin-mediated endocytosis in yeast and higher eukaryotes. Our data also demonstrate that the relationship between dynamin and actin is intimately connected to dynamin's endocytic role and that dynamin terminates a powerful actin- and BAR protein-dependent tubulating activity.},

However, endocytosis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is completely dependent on a functional actin cytoskeleton, while actin appears to be less critical in mammalian cell endocytosis. We reveal that the fundamental requirement for actin in early stages of yeast endocytosis is to provide a strong framework to support force generation required to direct the invaginating plasma membrane into the cell against turgor pressure. By providing osmotic support, pressure differences across the plasma membrane were removed and this reduced the requirement for actin-bundling proteins required for normal endocytosis. Conversely, increased turgor pressure in specific yeast mutants correlated with decreased rate of endocytic patch invagination.},

abstract = {Lipid membranes are key regulators of cellular function. An important step in membrane-related phenomena is the reshaping of the lipid bilayer, often induced by binding of macromolecules. Numerous experimental and simulation efforts have revealed that calcium, a ubiquitous cellular messenger, has a strong impact on the phase behavior, structural properties, and the stability of membranes. Yet, it is still unknown the way calcium and lipid interactions affect their macroscopic mechanical properties. In this work, we studied the interaction of calcium ions with membrane tethers pulled from giant unilamellar vesicles, to quantify the mechanical effect on the membrane. We found that calcium imposes a positive spontaneous curvature on negatively charged membranes, contrary to predictions we made based on the proposed atomic structure. Surprisingly, this effect vanishes in the presence of physiologically relevant concentrations of sodium chloride. Our work implies that calcium may be a trigger for membrane reshaping only at high concentrations, in a process that is robustly screened by sodium ions.},

abstract = {The ability to polarize is a fundamental property of cells. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has proven to be a fertile ground for dissecting the molecular mechanisms that regulate cell polarity during growth. Here we discuss the signaling pathways that regulate polarity. In the second installment of this two-part commentary, which appears in the next issue of Journal of Cell Science, we discuss how the actin cytoskeleton responds to these signals and guides the polarity of essentially all events in the yeast cell cycle. During the cell cycle, yeast cells assume alternative states of polarized growth, which range from tightly focused apical growth to non-focused isotropic growth. RhoGTPases, and in particular Cdc42p, are essential to guiding this polarity. The distribution of Cdc42p at the cell cortex establishes cell polarity. Cyclin-dependent protein kinase, Ras, and heterotrimeric G proteins all modulate yeast cell polarity in part by altering the distribution of Cdc42p. In turn, Cdc42p generates feedback signals to these molecules in order to establish stable polarity states and coordinate cytoskeletal organization with the cell cycle. Given that many of these signaling pathways are present in both fungi and animals, they are probably ancient and conserved mechanisms for regulating polarity.},

abstract = {Tissue cells sense and respond to the stiffness of the surface on which they adhere. Precisely how cells sense surface stiffness remains an open question, though various biochemical pathways are critical for a proper stiffness response. Here, based on a simple mechanochemical model of biological friction, we propose a model for cell mechanosensation as opposed to previous more biochemically based models. Our model of adhesion complexes predicts that these cell-surface interactions provide a viscous drag that increases with the elastic modulus of the surface. The force-velocity relation of myosin II implies that myosin generates greater force when the adhesion complexes slide slowly. Then, using a simple cytoskeleton model, we show that an external force applied to the cytoskeleton causes actin filaments to aggregate and orient parallel to the direction of force application. The greater the external force, the faster this aggregation occurs. As the steady-state probability of forming these bundles reflects a balance between the time scale of bundle formation and destruction (because of actin turnover), more bundles are formed when the cytoskeleton time-scale is small (i.e., on stiff surfaces), in agreement with experiment. As these large bundles of actin, called stress fibers, appear preferentially on stiff surfaces, our mechanical model provides a mechanism for stress fiber formation and stiffness sensing in cells adhered to a compliant surface.},

abstract = {Myosin is an actin-based motor protein that is involved in a wide range of cellular motile processes. Although in vitro properties of the myosin-actin interaction have been extensively studied, the interaction in vivo remains poorly understood. Recently, we developed a GFP-based strain sensor termed PriSSM (PRIM-based strain sensor module), by using the proximity imaging (PRIM) technique, which detects spectral changes of two GFP molecules that are in direct contact. Using PriSSM-myosin II fusion proteins, the interaction between myosin II and F-actin can be detected in Dictyostelium cells. In the spectroscopic measurements of PriSSM, to decompose the measured spectra of the cells expressing the sensor proteins into the contributions from the sensor and the background autofluorescence, we applied the linear spectral unmixing approach, which was based on the assumption that the errors at each wavelength were independent. Cellular autofluorescence, however, often includes systematic errors, so that the unmixing procedures might lead to biased estimates. Here, to validate our spectral unmixing procedures, we estimate the possible maximum errors in the fluorescence ratio values that are obtained by unmixing spectra including such systematic errors. This estimation provided a general criterion to validate the results obtained by linear unmixing of spectra including serially correlated error terms. Using the proposed criterion and PriSSM-myosin II fusion proteins, we examined the interaction between myosin II and F-actin in Dictyostelium cells under several different conditions. The spectroscopic results, together with the microscopic observations of the cells expressing the proteins, suggest that the formation of myosin filaments through the tail region has only a slight effect on binding to F-actin but has significant effects on the cortical localization of myosin II. {\textcopyright} 2010 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry},

In this study, we analyzed the dynamics of fluorescently tagged cofilin and the role of cofilin-mediated actin turnover during endocytosis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In living cells, cofilin is not necessary for actin assembly on endocytic membranes but is recruited to molecularly aged adenosine diphosphate actin filaments and is necessary for their rapid disassembly. Defects in cofilin function alter the morphology of actin networks in vivo and reduce the rate of actin flux through actin networks. The consequences of decreasing actin flux are manifested by decreased but not blocked endocytic internalization at the plasma membrane and defects in late steps of membrane trafficking to the vacuole. These results suggest that cofilin-mediated actin filament flux is required for the multiple steps of endocytic trafficking.},

The first shows that specific assembly of a clathrin protein scaffold, coupled to the membrane, seems to be the most prevalent mechanism for bending a lipid bilayer in a cell.

abstract = {Endocytosis is a dynamic process that cells use to take up their plasma membrane. Many proteins that function in endocytosis are known, and an extensive network of protein interactions occurs between these endocytic proteins. As a result identifying where and how these endocytic proteins function in the endocytic pathway has been challenging. Live-cell imaging studies have shown that a precisely choreographed assembly of proteins occurs at endocytic sites in both budding yeast and mammals, but these studies have only examined a handful of the over 50 proteins that function in endocytosis. Here the effects of over 60 deletion mutants on the dynamics of the budding yeast endocytic pathway were studied, revealing functions for 20 proteins. In addition to the previously analyzed endocytic proteins, novel spatio-temporal dynamics were described for ∼35 proteins at endocytic sites, indicating that at least 50 proteins associate with endocytic sites. Analyzing deletion phenotypes and spatio-temporal dynamics of endocytic proteins provided evidence for four protein modules that cooperate to drive budding yeast endocytosis. These studies determined that budding yeast endocytosis is clathrin-mediated. Furthermore, actin polymerization at the plasma membrane was found to play an essential role in driving endocytic internalization. A critical role for yeast amphiphysins in facilitating vesicle scission was also discovered. Finally, a complex pathway was uncovered for regulating disassembly of the endocytic coat after internalization. Overall, these studies have yielded a comprehensive understanding of the events that occur during budding yeast endocytosis.},

abstract = {Endocytosis of receptors at the plasma membrane is controlled by a complex mechanism that includes clathrin, adaptors, and actin regulators. Many of these proteins are conserved in yeast yet lack observable mutant phenotypes, which suggests that yeast endocytosis may be subject to different regulatory mechanisms. Here, we have systematically defined genes required for internalization using a quantitative genome-wide screen that monitors localization of the yeast vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP)/synaptobrevin homologue Snc1. Genetic interaction mapping was used to place these genes into functional modules containing known and novel endocytic regulators, and cargo selectivity was evaluated by an array-based comparative analysis. We demonstrate that clathrin and the yeast AP180 clathrin adaptor proteins have a cargo-specific role in Snc1 internalization. We additionally identify low dye binding 17 (LDB17) as a novel conserved component of the endocytic machinery. Ldb17 is recruited to cortical actin patches before actin polymerization and regulates normal coat dynamics and actin assembly. Our findings highlight the conserved machinery and reveal novel mechanisms that underlie endocytic internalization.},

Dynamin 1 oligomerized in the crystals via the stalks, which assemble in a criss-cross fashion. The stalks further interact via conserved surfaces with the pleckstrin homology domain and the bundle signalling element of the neighbouring dynamin molecule. This intricate domain interaction rationalizes a number of disease-related mutations in dynamin 2 and suggests a structural model for the mechanochemical coupling that reconciles previous models of dynamin function.},

@article{Urbanek2013,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Actin nucleation is the key rate-limiting step in actin polymerization, and tight regulation of this process is critical to ensure that actin filaments form only at specific regions of the cell. Las17 is the primary activator of Arp2/3-driven actin nucleation in yeast and is required for membrane invagination during endocytosis. Its mammalian homolog, WASP, has also been studied extensively as an activator of Arp2/3-driven actin polymerization. In both Las17 and WASP, actin nucleation activity is attributed to an ability to bind actin through a WH2 domain and to bind Arp2/3 through an acidic region. The central region of both Las17 and WASP is rich in proline residues and is generally considered to bind to SH3-domain-containing proteins.
RESULTS: We have identified a novel actin-binding activity in the polyproline domain of both yeast Las17 and mammalian WASP. The polyproline domain of Las17 is also able to nucleate actin filaments independently of Arp2/3. Mutational analysis reveals that proline residues are required for this nucleation activity and that the binding site on actin maps to a region distinct from those used by other nucleation activities. In vivo analysis of yeast strains expressing las17 mutated in the WH2 domain, one of its proline motifs, or both shows additive defects in actin organization and endocytosis, with the proline mutant conferring more severe phenotypes than the WH2 mutant.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate a new actin-binding and nucleation mechanism in Las17/WASP that is required for its function in actin regulation during endocytosis.},

Half a century of studies have uncovered tremendous insights into how a clathrin-coated vesicle is formed. More recently, the advent of live-cell imaging has provided a dynamic view of this process. As CME is highly conserved from yeast to humans, budding yeast provides an evolutionary template for this process and has been a valuable system for dissecting the underlying molecular mechanisms. In this review we trace the formation of a clathrin-coated vesicle from initiation to uncoating, focusing on key findings from the yeast system.

@article{Smith2013a,
abstract = {Most cells are neither perfect spheres nor amorphous blobs, but instead have characteristic shapes that enable them to carry out specific roles within tissues or organs. These shapes are established by a type of scaffolding, called the cytoskeleton, that gives structure to the cell, and also forms networks over which other proteins, and even organelles, can travel.

The filaments that make up the cytoskeleton are composed of various proteins, one of which is called actin. Cellular actin filaments can grow by adding new actin molecules, and actin filaments can also have ‘branches' that fork out from the mother filament. Branches grow out of an assembly of seven proteins known as the Arp2/3 complex, which attaches to the side of the mother filament. Branch growth is triggered by binding to the Arp2/3 complex of an additional protein, WASP, but the sequence of events required to initiate a new branch is not well understood. In particular, WASP is bound to cell membranes; at some point it must detach from the Arp2/3 complex so that the nearness of the membrane does not interfere with the growth of branches. Now, Smith et al. uncover how branch formation is triggered, and define a new role played by WASP in this process.

It is known that a specific region of the WASP protein called the VCA domain binds to both the Arp2/3 complex and actin. Smith et al. studied how this domain could initiate branch formation, and showed that a pair of VCA domains linked to each other, along with an Arp2/3 complex, could interact jointly with an existing actin filament before a new branch formed. However, new branches did not form unless the VCA-domain pair detached from the actin filament, leaving the Arp2/3 complex behind. Additionally, Smith et al. found that mutant VCA-domain pairs detached from the actin filament at different rates, which then determined the chance that a new branch formed.

These findings—and those of Helgeson and Nolen published concurrently in eLife —suggest that, in cells, two WASP proteins first recruit the Arp2/3 complex to the membrane, and that together they interact with an existing actin filament. The WASP proteins then release the filament, and only then does the Arp2/3 complex initiate the formation of an actin branch. Since the Arp2/3 complex is no longer attached to WASP, subsequent growth of the branch is not physically limited by linkage to the membrane.

abstract = {During tissue morphogenesis, simple epithelial sheets undergo folding to form complex structures. The prevailing model underlying epithelial folding involves cell shape changes driven by myosin-dependent apical constriction. Here we describe an alternative mechanism that requires differential positioning of adherens junctions controlled by modulation of epithelial apical-basal polarity. Using live embryo imaging, we show that before the initiation of dorsal transverse folds during Drosophila gastrulation, adherens junctions shift basally in the initiating cells, but maintain their original subapical positioning in the neighbouring cells. Junctional positioning in the dorsal epithelium depends on the polarity proteins Bazooka and Par-1. In particular, the basal shift that occurs in the initiating cells is associated with a progressive decrease in Par-1 levels. We show that uniform reduction of the activity of Bazooka or Par-1 results in uniform apical or lateral positioning of junctions and in each case dorsal fold initiation is abolished. In addition, an increase in the Bazooka/Par-1 ratio causes formation of ectopic dorsal folds. The basal shift of junctions not only alters the apical shape of the initiating cells, but also forces the lateral membrane of the adjacent cells to bend towards the initiating cells, thereby facilitating tissue deformation. Our data thus establish a direct link between modification of epithelial polarity and initiation of epithelial folding.},

abstract = {The Bin1/amphiphysin/Rvs167 (BAR) domain proteins are a ubiquitous protein family. Genes encoding members of this family have not yet been found in the genomes of prokaryotes, but within eukaryotes, BAR domain proteins are found universally from unicellular eukaryotes such as yeast through to plants, insects, and vertebrates. BAR domain proteins share an N-terminal BAR domain with a high propensity to adopt $\alpha$-helical structure and engage in coiled-coil interactions with other proteins. BAR domain proteins are implicated in processes as fundamental and diverse as fission of synaptic vesicles, cell polarity, endocytosis, regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, transcriptional repression, cell-cell fusion, signal transduction, apoptosis, secretory vesicle fusion, excitation-contraction coupling, learning and memory, tissue differentiation, ion flux across membranes, and tumor suppression. What has been lacking is a molecular understanding of the role of the BAR domain protein in each process. The three-dimensional structure of the BAR domain has now been determined and valuable insight has been gained in understanding the interactions of BAR domains with membranes. The cellular roles of BAR domain proteins, characterized over the past decade in cells as distinct as yeasts, neurons, and myocytes, can now be understood in terms of a fundamental molecular function of all BAR domain proteins: to sense membrane curvature, to bind GTPases, and to mold a diversity of cellular membranes.},

abstract = {Background information. Mechanical forces play an important role in the organization, growth and function of living tissues. The ability of cells to transduce mechanical signals is governed by two types of microscale structures: focal adhesions, which link cells to the extracellular matrix, and adherens junctions, which link adjacent cells through cadherins. Although many studies have examined forces induced by focal adhesions, there is little known about the role of adherens junctions in force-regulation processes. The present study focuses on the determination of force transduction through cadherins at a single cell level.Results. We characterized for the first time the distribution of forces developed by the cell through cadherin contacts. A N-cadherin (neural cadherin)–Fc chimaera, which mimicks the cell adhesion molecule N-cadherin, was immobilized on a $\mu$FSA (micro-force sensor array), comprising a dense array of vertical elastomer pillars, which were used both as a cell culture support for N-cadherin-expressing C2 myogenic cells and as detectors for force mapping. We coated the top of the pillars on which cells adhere and recruit adhesion complexes and F-actin. Individual pillar bending allowed the measurement of forces that mainly developed at the cell edge and directed toward their centre. Similar force distribution and amplitude were detected with an unrelated cell line of neuronal origin. Further comparison with forces applied by cells on pillars coated with fibronectin indicates that mechanical stresses transduced through both types of adhesions were comparable in distribution, orientation and amplitude.Conclusions. These results present a versatile method to measure and map forces exerted by cell—cell adhesion complexes. They show that cells transduce mechanical stress through cadherin contacts which are of the same order as magnitude of those previously characterized for focal adhesions. Altogether, they emphasize the mechanotransduction role of cytoskeleton-linked adhesion receptors of the cadherin family in tissue cohesion and reshaping.},

abstract = {Mechanosensitive (MS) channels are expressed in various cells in a wide range of phylogenetic lineages from bacteria to humans. Understanding the molecular and biophysical mechanisms of their activation is an important research pursuit. It is controversial whether eukaryotic MS channels need accessory proteins -- typically cytoskeletal structures -- for activation, because MS channel activities are modulated by pharmacological treatments that affect the cytoskeleton. Here we demonstrate that direct mechanical stimulation (stretching) of an actin stress fiber using optical tweezers can activate MS channels in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Furthermore, by using high-speed total internal reflection microscopy, we visualized spots of Ca(2+) influx across individual MS channels distributed near focal adhesions in the basal surface of HUVECs. This study provides the first direct evidence that the cytoskeleton works as a force-transmitting and force-focusing molecular device to activate MS channels in eukaryotic cells.},

@article{Blanchoin2000a,
abstract = {Background: Cellular movements are powered by the assembly and disassembly of actin filaments. Actin dynamics are controlled by Arp2/3 complex, the Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome protein (WASp) and the related Scar protein, capping protein, profilin, and the actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF, also known as cofilin). Recently, using an assay that both reveals the kinetics of overall reactions and allows visualization of actin filaments, we showed how these proteins co-operate in the assembly of branched actin filament networks. Here, we investigated how they work together to disassemble the networks.Results: Actin filament branches formed by polymerization of ATP–actin in the presence of activated Arp2/3 complex were found to be metastable, dissociating from the mother filament with a half time of 500 seconds. The ADF/cofilin protein actophorin reduced the half time for both dissociation of $\gamma$-phosphate from ADP–Pi–actin filaments and debranching to 30 seconds. Branches were stabilized by phalloidin, which inhibits phosphate dissociation from ADP–Pi–filaments, and by BeF3, which forms a stable complex with ADP and actin. Arp2/3 complex capped pointed ends of ATP–actin filaments with higher affinity (Kd ∼40nM) than those of ADP–actin filaments (Kd ∼1$\mu$M), explaining why phosphate dissociation from ADP–Pi–filaments liberates branches. Capping protein prevented annealing of short filaments after debranching and, with profilin, allowed filaments to depolymerize at the pointed ends.Conclusions: The low affinity of Arp2/3 complex for the pointed ends of ADP–actin makes actin filament branches transient. By accelerating phosphate dissociation, ADF/cofilin promotes debranching. Barbed-end capping proteins and profilin allow dissociated branches to depolymerize from their free pointed ends.},

abstract = {Fusion of exocytotic vesicles with the plasma membrane gives rise to an increase in membrane surface area, whereas the surface area is decreased when vesicles are internalized during endocytosis. Changes in membrane surface area, resulting from fusion and fission of membrane vesicles, can be followed by monitoring the corresponding proportional changes in membrane capacitance. Using the cell-attached configuration of the patch-clamp techniques we were able to resolve the elementary processes of endo- and exocytosis in yeast protoplasts at high temporal and spatial resolution. Spontaneous capacitance changes were predominantly in the range of 0.2–1 fF which translates to vesicle diameters of 90–200 nm. The size distribution revealed that endocytotic vesicles with a median at about 132 nm were smaller than exocytotic vesicles with a median at 155 nm. In energized and metabolizing protoplasts, endo- and exocytotic events occurred at frequencies of 1.6 and 2.7 events per minute, respectively. Even though these numbers appear very low, they are in good agreement with the observed growth rate of yeast cells and protoplasts.},

abstract = {Latrunculin A is used extensively as an agent to sequester monomeric actin in living cells. We hypothesize that additional activities of latrunculin A may be important for its biological activity. Our data are consistent with the formation of a 1:1 stoichiometric complex with an equilibrium dissociation constant of 0.2 to 0.4 $\mu$m and provide no evidence that the actin-latrunculin A complex participates in the elongation of actin filaments. Profilin and latrunculin A bind independently to actin, whereas binding of thymosin $\beta$4 to actin is inhibited by latrunculin A. Potential implications of this differential effect on actin-binding proteins are discussed. From a structural perspective, if latrunculin A binds to actin at a site that sterically influences binding by thymosin $\beta$4, then the observation that latrunculin A inhibits nucleotide exchange on actin implies an allosteric effect on the nucleotide binding cleft. Alternatively, if, as previously postulated, latrunculin A binds in the nucleotide cleft of actin, then its ability to inhibit binding by thymosin $\beta$4 is a surprising result that suggests that significant allosteric changes affect the thymosin $\beta$4 binding site. We show that latrunculin A and actin form a crystalline structure with orthorhombic space group P212121and diffraction to 3.10 {\AA}. A high resolution structure with optimized crystallization conditions should provide insight regarding these remarkable allosteric properties.},

abstract = {Using a biochemically complex cytoplasmic extract to reconstitute actin-based motility of Listeria monocytogenes and polystyrene beads coated with the bacterial protein ActA, we have systematically varied a series of biophysical parameters and examined their effects on initiation of motility, particle speed, speed variability, and path trajectory. Bead size had a profound effect on all aspects of motility, with increasing size causing slower, straighter movement and inhibiting symmetry-breaking. Speed also was reduced by extract dilution, by addition of methylcellulose, and paradoxically by addition of excess skeletal muscle actin, but it was enhanced by addition of nonmuscle (platelet) actin. Large, persistent individual variations in speed were observed for all conditions and their relative magnitude increased with extract dilution, indicating that persistent alterations in particle surface properties may be responsible for intrinsic speed variations. Trajectory curvature was increased for smaller beads and also for particles moving in the presence of methylcellulose or excess skeletal muscle actin. Symmetry breaking and movement initiation occurred by two distinct modes: either stochastic amplification of local variation for small beads in concentrated extracts, or gradual accumulation of strain in the actin gel for large beads in dilute extracts. Neither mode was sufficient to enable spherical particles to break symmetry in the cytoplasm of living cells.},

The mechanical microenvironment is known to influence single-cell migration; however, the extent to which mechanical cues affect collective migration of adherent cells is not well understood. We measured the effects of varying substrate compliance on individual cell migratory properties in an epithelial wound-healing assay. Increasing substrate stiffness increased collective cell migration speed, persistence, and directionality as well as the coordination of cell movements. Dynamic analysis revealed that wounding initiated a wave of motion coordination from the wound edge into the sheet. This was accompanied by a front-to-back gradient of myosin-II activation and establishment of cell polarity. The propagation was faster and farther reaching on stiff substrates, indicating that substrate stiffness affects the transmission of directional cues. Manipulation of myosin-II activity and cadherin–catenin complexes revealed that this transmission is mediated by coupling of contractile forces between neighboring cells. Thus, our findings suggest that the mechanical environment integrates in a feedback with cell contractility and cell–cell adhesion to regulate collective migration.},

Consistent with this, Pil1 plays a crucial role in maintaining normal PI(4,5)P2 levels at the plasma membrane., The plasma membrane delineates the cell and mediates its communication and material exchange with the environment. Many processes of the plasma membrane occur through interactions of proteins with phosphatidylinositol(4,5)-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), which is highly enriched in this membrane and is a key determinant of its identity. Eisosomes function in lateral organization of the plasma membrane, but the molecular function of their major protein subunits, the BAR domain–containing proteins Pil1 and Lsp1, is poorly understood. Here we show that eisosomes interact with the PI(4,5)P2 phosphatase Inp51/Sjl1, thereby recruiting it to the plasma membrane. Pil1 is essential for plasma membrane localization and function of Inp51 but not for the homologous phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate phosphatases Inp52/Sjl2 and Inp53/Sjl3. Consistent with this, absence of Pil1 increases total and available PI(4,5)P2 levels at the plasma membrane. On the basis of these findings, we propose a model in which the eisosomes function in maintaining PI(4,5)P2 levels by Inp51/Sjl1 recruitment.},

abstract = {Neurotransmission requires a continuously available pool of synaptic vesicles (SVs) that can fuse with the plasma membrane and release their neurotransmitter contents upon stimulation. After fusion, SV membranes and membrane proteins are retrieved from the presynaptic plasma membrane by clathrin-mediated endocytosis. After the internalization of a clathrin-coated vesicle, the vesicle must uncoat to replenish the pool of SVs. Clathrin-coated vesicle uncoating requires ATP and is mediated by the ubiquitous molecular chaperone Hsc70. In vitro, depolymerized clathrin forms a stable complex with Hsc70*ADP. This complex can be dissociated by nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs) that release ADP from Hsc70, allowing ATP to bind and induce disruption of the clathrin:Hsc70 association. Whether NEFs generally play similar roles in vesicle trafficking in vivo and whether they play such roles in SV endocytosis in particular is unknown. To address this question, we used information from recent structural and mechanistic studies of Hsp70:NEF and Hsp70:co-chaperone interactions to design a NEF inhibitor. Using acute perturbations at giant reticulospinal synapses of the sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus), we found that this NEF inhibitor inhibited SV endocytosis. When this inhibitor was mutated so that it could no longer bind and inhibit Hsp110 (a NEF that we find to be highly abundant in brain cytosol), its ability to inhibit SV endocytosis was eliminated. These observations indicate that the action of a NEF, most likely Hsp110, is normally required during SV trafficking to release clathrin from Hsc70 and make it available for additional rounds of endocytosis.},

abstract = {The actin cytoskeleton provides the structural basis for cell polarity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae as well as most other eukaryotes. In Part I of this two-part commentary, presented in the previous issue of Journal of Cell Science, we discussed the basis by which yeast establishes and maintains different states of polarity through Ρ GTPases and cyclin-dependent protein kinase signaling. Here we discuss how, in response to those signals, the actin cytoskeleton guides growth of the yeast cell. A polarized array of actin cables at the cell cortex is the primary structural determinant of polarity. Motors such as class V myosins use this array to transport secretory vesicles, mRNA and organelles towards growth sites, where they are anchored by a cap of cytoskeletal and regulatory proteins. Cortical actin patches enhance and maintain this polarity, probably through endocytic recycling, which allows reuse of materials and prevents continued growth at old sites. The dynamic arrangement of targeting and recycling provides flexibility for the precise control of morphogenesis.},

For these experiments, we use differentiated Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells. Our data provide definite information on mechanical forces exerted by a cellular assembly. The maximum intensity of the forces is localized on the edge of the epithelia. Hepatocyte growth factor promotes cell motility and induces strong scattering activity of MDCK cells. Thus, we compare forces generated by MDCK cells in subconfluent epithelia versus isolated cells after hepatocyte growth factor treatment. Maximal-traction stresses at the edge of a monolayer correspond to higher values than those measured for a single cell and may be due to a collective behavior.},

abstract = {Summary
Actomyosin flows are involved in a variety of cellular processes, including cytokinesis, cell migration, polarization, and morphogenesis. In epithelia, flow polarization orients cell deformations. It is unclear, however, how flows are polarized and how global patterns of junction remodeling emerge from flow polarization locally. We address this question during intercalation-driving extension of the Drosophila germband. Intercalation is associated with polarized junction remodeling, whereby actomyosin pulses flow anisotropically toward dorsal-ventral junctions and shrink them. Here, we show that planar polarization of flows emerges from polarized fluctuations in the levels of E-cadherin clusters that produce transient and oscillating asymmetries of coupling. These fluctuations are triggered by polarized E-cadherin endocytosis and are amplified by flow itself. This work suggests that fluctuations and mechanical instability are not the consequences of limited control over the systems key parameters, but rather that they define the axis of symmetry breaking.},

By immobilizing microscopic chromatin-coated beads on slide surfaces using a microprinting technique, we have examined the effect of chromatin on the dimensions and symmetry of spindles in Xenopus laevis cytoplasmic extracts. While circular spots with diameters around 14–18 $\mu$m trigger bipolar spindle formation, larger spots generate an incorrect number of poles. We also examined lines of chromatin with various dimensions. Their length determined the number of poles that formed, with a 6 × 18 $\mu$m rectangular patch generating normal spindle morphology. Around longer lines, multiple poles formed and the structures were disorganized. While lines thinner than 10 $\mu$m generated symmetric structures, thicker lines induced the formation of asymmetric structures where all microtubules are on the same side of the line. Our results show that chromatin defines spindle shape and orientation.For a video summary of this article, see the PaperFlick file available with the online Supplemental Data.},

Understanding the molecular and biophysical mechanisms of their activation is an important research pursuit. It is controversial whether eukaryotic MS channels need accessory proteins – typically cytoskeletal structures – for activation, because MS channel activities are modulated by pharmacological treatments that affect the cytoskeleton. Here we demonstrate that direct mechanical stimulation (stretching) of an actin stress fiber using optical tweezers can activate MS channels in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Furthermore, by using high-speed total internal reflection microscopy, we visualized spots of Ca2+ influx across individual MS channels distributed near focal adhesions in the basal surface of HUVECs. This study provides the first direct evidence that the cytoskeleton works as a force-transmitting and force-focusing molecular device to activate MS channels in eukaryotic cells.},

abstract = {During clathrin-mediated endocytosis, branched actin polymerization nucleated by the Arp2/3 complex provides force needed to drive vesicle internalization. Las17 (yeast WASp) is the strongest activator of the Arp2/3 complex in yeast cells; it is not autoinhibited and arrives to endocytic sites 20 s before actin polymerization begins. It is unclear how Las17 is kept inactive for 20 s at endocytic sites, thus restricting actin polymerization to late stages of endocytosis. In this paper, we demonstrate that Las17 is part of a large and biochemically stable complex with Sla1, a clathrin adaptor that inhibits Las17 activity. The interaction is direct, multivalent, and strong, and was mapped to novel Las17 polyproline motifs that are simultaneously class I and class II. In vitro pyrene-actin polymerization assays established that Sla1 inhibition of Las17 activity depends on the class I/II Las17 polyproline motifs and is based on competition between Sla1 and monomeric actin for binding to Las17. Furthermore, live-cell imaging showed the interaction with Sla1 is important for normal Las17 recruitment to endocytic sites, inhibition during the initial 20 s, and efficient endocytosis. These results advance our understanding of the regulation of actin polymerization in endocytosis.},

The mechanism driving clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) involves {\textgreater} 50 different protein components assembling at a single location on the plasma membrane in a temporally ordered and hierarchal pathway. These proteins perform precisely choreographed steps that promote receptor recognition and clustering, membrane remodeling, and force-generating actin-filament assembly and turnover to drive membrane invagination and vesicle scission. Many critical aspects of the CME mechanism are conserved from yeast to mammals and were first elucidated in yeast, demonstrating that it is a powerful system for studying endocytosis. In this review, we describe our current mechanistic understanding of each step in the process of yeast CME, and the essential roles played by actin polymerization at these sites, while providing a historical perspective of how the landscape has changed since the preceding version of the YeastBook was published 17 years ago (1997). Finally, we discuss the key unresolved issues and where future studies might be headed.},

abstract = {Background
Actin polymerization by Arp2/3 complex must be tightly regulated to promote endocytosis. While many Arp2/3 complex activators have been identified, mechanisms for its negative regulation have remained more elusive. We analyzed the yeast arp2-7 allele, which is biochemically unique in causing unregulated actin assembly in vitro in the absence of Arp2/3 activators.

Results
We examined endocytosis in arp2-7 mutants by live cell imaging of Sla1-GFP, a coat marker, and Abp1-RFP, which marks the later actin phase of endocytosis. Sla1-GFP and Abp1-RFP lifetimes were accelerated in arp2-7 mutants, which is opposite to actin nucleation-impaired arp2 alleles or deletions of Arp2/3 activators. We performed a screen for multi-copy suppressors of arp2-7 and identified SYP1, a FCHO1 homologue, which contains F-BAR and AP-2$\mu$ homology domains. Over-expression of SYP1 in arp2-7 cells slowed Sla1-GFP lifetimes closer to wild type cells. Further, purified Syp1 directly inhibited Las17/WASp stimulation of Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin assembly. This activity was mapped to a fragment of Syp1 located between its F-BAR and AP-2$\mu$ homology domains, and depends on non-VCA sequences in Las17/WASp.

Conclusions
Together, these data identify Syp1 as a novel negative regulator of WASp-Arp2/3 complex that helps choreograph the precise timing of actin assembly during endocytosis.},
