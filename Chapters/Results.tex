	This is where the results go. And then some more results. And more.
In addition, some BAR proteins act as effectors or regula- tors of Rho-family GTPases: they recruit the phosphoinositide phosphatase Synaptojanin, which regulates PI(4,5) P2
and PI(3,4,5)P3 , and dynamin, whose
role in membrane fi ssion is intercon- nected with actin dynamics (Itoh and De Camilli, 2006; Takenawa and Suetsugu,
2007). Other
