The plasma membrane serves as the defining barrier between the internal and external cell, thus creating cellular identity, and facilitates evolution out of the primordial soup into a defined structure that can regulate entry of signals into the cell. In eukaryotes, and with increasing complexity, in multicellular eukaryotes, tuning response to external signals has resulted in a complex network of signaling pathways, and a tight coupling of these pathways with the process of endocytosis. Endocytosis is defined as the uptake of molecules too big to simply pass through the plasma membrane. Somewhat dramatically, it “constitutes the major communications infrastructure of the cell. As such, it governs almost all aspects of the relationships of the cell with the extracellular environment and of intracellular communication. Its evolution constitutes, arguably, the major driving force in the evolution of prokaryotic to eukaryotic organisms” (Di Fiore 2012).  Apart from internalizing molecules, endocytosis allows regulation of the plasma membrane itself: its lipid and protein composition, and therefore many physical and biochemical properties like tension, rigidity, surface receptor composition. Endocytosis is therefore an ancient pathway that has likely contributed to the evolution of cellular diversity and specificity, allowing organization of signaling pathways, and plasma membrane homeostasis and composition.
