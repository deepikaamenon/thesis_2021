\section{Dynamin action, lipid hydrolysis, and protein friction do not drive scission}
Some studies have suggested that Vps1 does localize to endoytic sites, and affects the scission mechanism: Nannapaneni et al.,23 find that the lifetime of Las17, Sla1, Abp1 increase in the absence of Vps1. Rooij et al.,24. find that Rvs167 lifetimes increase, and are recruited in fewer patches to the cell cortex. On the other hand, vps1Δ did not increase the scission failure rate of rvs167Δ in other studies25, and did not colocalize with other endocytic proteins26. We see a slight but insignificant increase in Rvs167 lifetimes in vps1Δ cells. If Vps1 was to affect scission, the number of failed scission events should increase in vps1Δ cells, and increase the lengths of invaginated tubes, but we do not find so. Synaptojanin-mediated scission model19 predicts that first, vesicle scission would occur at the top of the invaginated tube, at the interphase of the hydrolyzed and non-hydrolyzed lipid. Kukulski et al.,16 have shown that vesicles undergo scission at 2/3 the invagination depths: that is, vesicles generated by lipid hydrolysis based line tension would be much smaller than have been seen. Second, removing forces generated by lipid hydrolysis should then increase the invagination lengths measured. Deletion of Inp51 and Inp52 do not change the invagination depths at which scission occurs, as measured from the maximum movement of the averaged Sla1 trajectory. Protein friction does not appear to contribute significantly to membrane scission, since invagination depths do not change if more BAR protein is localized to membrane tubes.


\section{Inp52 is likely involved in uncoating vesicles after scission}
Deletion of Synaptojanin-like Inp52 does not affect the invagination depths of Sla1, but Sla1 patches persist for longer after scission in the inp52Δ than in WT cells, as do patches of Rvs167, indicated by the arrows in Fig.2. Both delays suggest that rather than the scission time-point, post- scission disassembly of proteins from the vesicle is inhibited by the deletion, and that Inp52 plays a role in recycling endocytic proteins to the plasma membrane.

\section{Rvs does not form a tight scaffold on yeast membrane tubes}
Cryo EM structures of mammalian BAR proteins have suggested that the Rvs complex forms a similar helical scaffold with lateral interactions between adjacent BAR domains on invaginated membrane tubes. In the Rvs overexpression strains, Rvs can be recruited in much higher numbers, and at a much faster rate to the membrane than in WT cells, but appears to have similar disassembly dynamics as in the WT (Fig.5). The atypical, sharp decay fluorescent signal indicates that all of the Rvs on the membrane is suddenly released, consistent with the idea of a scaffold that breaks upon vesicle scission, releasing all the membrane-bound BAR protein. The decay in the 4x Rvs strain suggests that all the Rvs is also bound to the membrane, and since the membrane is now able to accommodate about 1.6x the amount of BAR protein as the WT on the same amount of membrane, it appears that in the WT case, a tight helix that covers the entire tube was not likely to be formed: adding molecules to such a tube would result in a change in at least disassembly dynamics.

\section{The SH3 domain helps recruitment of Rvs to endocytic sites}
Unexpectedly, the lack of SH3 domain affects the recruitment of Rvs to the plasma membrane, even though the amount of protein expressed is the same (from analyzing cytoplasmic signal in Rvs167-GFP vs rvs167Δ SH3-GFP cells, not shown). This indicates that the SH3 domain increases the efficiency of recruitment of Rvs to invaginated tubes. Transient cortical patches in LatA treated cells expressing Rvs167-GFP that are absent in LatA cells expressing rvs167Δ SH3-GFP (Fig.1A) suggests that the former patches are caused by an interaction mediated by the SH3 domain; SH3 interaction with the an endocytic binding partner could recruit Rvs to sites. Many such interaction partners have been proposed; Abp1 interaction with the Rvs167 SH3 domain has been shown27,28, Las1729,30, Cmd131, type I myosins32, Vrp127, which recruits the myosins, have all emerged as potential candidates, and are being studied as potential targets of the Rvs167 SH3 domain.

\section{Rvs scaffolds membrane pore}
Sla1 in rvs167Δ cells undergoes scission at short invagination lengths of about 60nm (Fig.4) , compared to the WT lengths of 140nm16; Rvs167 is required at membrane tubes to prevent premature scission. This is consistent with the SH3 domain mediating actin forces to the invagination neck, causing scission, as well as with Rvs167 stabilizing the membrane invagination via membrane interactions of the BAR domain33. Since WT invagination depths are reproduced by overexpression of the BAR domain alone, we propose that localization of Rvs to the membrane tube stabilizes the membrane pore, and allows deep invaginations to grow until actin polymerization produces enough forces to sever the membrane and cause scission. Here, the forces are generated entirely by actin polymerization, and the amount of force necessary is determined by the physical properties of the membrane.

position of the early-arriving proteins. After recruitment to eisosomes by the anchoring of an early-arriving protein, the early-arriving proteins had a different distribution to the late proteins. But this distribution was not completely spatially separate; Yap1802 for example was persistent at the eisosome but also moved in with the invagination (Fig. 16). Also Sla2 and Ent1/2 are present during the early phase but have an essential role in membrane invagination during the late phase (Skruzny et al., 2012, 2015). Rather this separation is best understood at the level of the function of these phases. It means that the molecular events of the early phase are not mechanistically required for vesicle budding, which can therefore occur regardless of the exact initiation mechanism and the composition of the early-arriving proteins. 
Early-arriving proteins recruited to eisosomes formed persistent patches around which multiple budding events occurred (Fig. 16). This is reminiscent of endocytic hotspots, which have been reported in mammalian cells (Gaidarov et al., 1999; Merrifield et al., 2005; Nunez et al., 2011). It is difficult to explain the formation of these hotspots if endocytosis is considered as a linear process, in which a precise initiation event leads to the budding of a vesicle. However I propose that the vesicle budding process is not integrally coupled to the initiation mechanism. It is therefore easy to imagine how the early-arriving proteins could remain at the plasma membrane and initiate multiple budding events. 
5.7.2. What is the significance of flexibility in initiation? 
A redundancy in the initiating protein composition means that different initiation mechanisms could occur depending on the situation. This could allow for regulation over the process depending on the environment of the cell. Endocytosis could be regulated by the positioning of the process – as is seen in polarised endocytosis in yeast cells (Pruyne and Bretscher, 2000a), by the rate of endocytosis – which is increased after stimulated secretion and completely inhibited during mitosis (Raucher and Sheetz, 1999), and by the type of cargo to be taken up – which is determined by the adaptor composition (Traub, 2009). A flexibility in initiation allows for a robust process of vesicle budding with the ability to respond to different signalling or cellular environments, depending on the organism and cell type. This is clearly important for a cellular process that is essential but also adaptable over development and evolution.
