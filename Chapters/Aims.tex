The final stage of endocytosis involves breaking a tubular membrane invagination into a vesicle. Over fifty different proteins are involved in establishing endocytic sites, and forming an actin netwrok that pulls up the membrane. Only two proteins are  definitely invovled in the scission stage, Rvs167 and Rvs161 that form the  BAR domain protein complex Rvs. Rvs arrives at invaginated membranes. As BAR domain complexes are intrinsically curved, Rvs likely interacts with membrane curvature. 

 \textit{in situ} within the endocytic machinery. More specifically, I addressed the following questions:

\begin{itemize}
	\item How is Rvs recruited to endocytic sites? 
\end{itemize}

Failure to recruit Rvs results in a high rate of scission failure, and smaller vesicles, indicated that Rvs prevents premature membrane scission. In this thesis I 

\begin{itemize}
	\item What is the function of Rvs?
