The final stage of endocytosis involves breaking a tubular membrane invagination into a vesicle. Over fifty different proteins are involved in establishing endocytic sites and forming an actin network that pulls up the membrane. Only two proteins are  definitively invovled in the scission stage, Rvs161 and Rvs167, that form the BAR domain protein complex Rvs. Rvs arrives at invaginated membranes. As BAR domains have curved structuress, Rvs likely interacts with membrane curvature, but whether it is recruited by membrane curvature is not known. The first part of this thesis address the question of BAR-membrane interaction, and addresses the question:


\begin{itemize}
	\item How is Rvs recruited to endocytic sites? 
\end{itemize}

Rvs deletion results in a high rate of scission failure, and formation of smaller vesicles than in cells with Rvs, indicating that localization of the complex likely prevents premature membrane scission. In the second portion of this thesis I test several proposed scission mechanisms that could explain the influence of Rvs on scission dynamics. The purpose is to determine, specifically: 

\begin{itemize}
	\item What is the function of Rvs?
	\item What causes membrane scission? 
\end{itemize}
