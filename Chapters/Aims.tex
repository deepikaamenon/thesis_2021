More than 50 different proteins are involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. At endocytic sites, they assemble into a small, complex and dynamic macromolecular machinery. Although individual components have been identified and well-characterized during decades of research, their structural organization is poorly understood. In my PhD project, I proposed that single-molecule localization based superresolution microscopy provides both the molecular specificity and necessary spatial resolution to study how proteins are arranged \textit{in situ} within the endocytic machinery. More specifically, I addressed the following questions:

\begin{itemize}
	\item How is Rvs recruited to endocytic sites? 
\end{itemize}

The recently developed technique of localization microscopy critically depends on dense and specific fluorescent labeling of the cellular structure of interest with a dye suitable for localization microscopy. In the first part of my project, I established an optimized sample preparation pipeline to enable high quality dual-color localization microscopy of yeast cells. These efforts are described in section \ref{LocMic_yeast}.

\begin{itemize}
	\item How does it regulate scission 
\end{itemize}
