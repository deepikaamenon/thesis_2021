The final stage of endocytosis involves breaking a tubular membrane invagination into a vesicle. Over fifty different proteins are involved in establishing endocytic sites, and forming an actin netwrok that pulls up the membrane. Only two proteins are  definitely invovled in the scission stage, Rvs167 and Rvs161 that form the  BAR domain protein complex Rvs. Rvs arrives at invaginated membranes. As BAR domains have curved structuress, Rvs likely interacts with membrane curvature, but whether it is recruited by membrane curvature is not known. The first part of this thesis address the question of BAR-membrane interaction, and aims to answer the question:


\begin{itemize}
	\item How is Rvs recruited to endocytic sites? 
\end{itemize}

Rvs deletion results in a high rate of scission failure, and causes formation of smaller vesicles than in cells with Rvs, indicating that localization of the complex likely prevents premature membrane scission. In the second portion of this thesis I 

\begin{itemize}
	\item What is the function of Rvs?
