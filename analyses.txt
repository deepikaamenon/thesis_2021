Analysis
cytoplasmic background for sla2_del cells, vs control
vps_Del vs wt retraction rate of sla1
lifetime of sla1-GFP and vps_del patches?

figures
sla2_del
-change wt rvs vs BAR-GPF kymographs for the ones with the same exposure rate
-cant actually see patches of GFP in the latA cells: change the onctrast, or something!
-need figure labels A to H

vps_del
-include prediction?
-Vps-GFP at 37C has not been flipped!
-WT rvs needs to move down a bit

inp_del
include schematic of the model, and prediction?
